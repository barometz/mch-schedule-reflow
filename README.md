This is the schedule for [MCH2022](https://mch2022.org), this year's installment
of the (almost) four-yearly hacker/maker/artist camp/festival/event that takes
place in the Netherlands.

This document was generated from the "frab-compatible" JSON file which can be
found at <https://program.mch2022.org/>. Aside from this section, all content is
from there; this is only meant as a reflowable way to read the schedule.
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) was used to generate the ePub and HTML files.

The source for the generator can be found at
<https://github.com/barometz/mch-schedule-reflow> (it's rough; this is the first
useful thing I've written in Rust).
