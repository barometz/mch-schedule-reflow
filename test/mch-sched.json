They want to find out exactly who or what should be nailed to the cross, and what the world might look like after a resurrection.Taking the St Matthew Passion as a starting point, both for the valuable lessons as well as musical inspiration. Armed with Bachst\u2019 St Matthew Passion and synthesizers we will look for a new way of dealing with big tech.\r\n\r\nSETUP (Utrecht) is a media lab exploring the day-to-day future of technology. Using a critical yet humorous perspective, SETUP translates complex themes into more tangible ideas for everyone. In 2021, SETUP asked several artists to offer new perspectives on penance and forgiveness for big tech, using the St Matthew Passion. A composed group consisting of multidisciplinary theater collective de Transmissie and musician Rodrigo Ferreira came to a stunning result, with live performances from Theater Kikker and Pakhuis de Zwijger in April 2021. The new performance in 2022 is the next step in this research.",

What impact do new technologies have on society? What negative consequences can digitalization have and how can we steer developments towards more fruitful futures?\r\n\r\nTo make this happen, we collaborate with artists, designers, scientists and other specialists in artistic research to imagine and visualize these possible futures. Over the years, we have developed a distinctive style, which allows us to translate complex issues into mediagenic, straight-to-the-heart projects and works of art. We stimulate people to create an ethical countermovement. To see what we can \u2013 or have to \u2013 do differently. That is why our artistic research is aimed at a wide audience and why we collaborate with governmental institutions, schools, libraries and other organizations.",

The Internet is both a familiar, comfortable place as well as a bottomless rabbit hole you can lose yourself in. The Internet has always been like this from its inception, the difference now is the scale and consequences are almost immeasurable - and it tests the limits of human imagination. When you look into the mirror of the Internet what you see reflected back depends on what you are looking for. It has become largely a reflection of yourself.",
                                "description": "Some inventions are so good that they change the world. When a new innovation is useful enough, we no longer want to live without it \u2013 and once a technology is practical enough, it soon becomes compulsory.\r\n\r\nElectrical networks are a good example of this. While it is hard to imagine modern life without electricity, electrical networks are a fairly recent invention. Nowadays, a power outage brings everything to a halt. If an outage is extensive, not only homes will be affected \u2013 shops and factories also close. Once these networks are down, society will be offline. Modern society could only last for a few days in a complete power outage. \r\n\r\nIf the Internet were to fail, the impacts would be much less dramatic. Society would not stop during a network outage. Factories would continue to operate. Information would flow via TV antennas and FM radio. Of course, work would be much more difficult without network connections. Most monetary transactions would also cease. In a nutshell, internet outages are expensive, but they don't kill people. \r\n\r\nI predict that, before long, the information network and electrical network will be equally important to our society. Before long, much like a power outage, a network outage will bring life to a halt. In fact, before long, a network outage will also mean a power outage.\r\n\r\nElectrical networks have been highly beneficial, but we have become highly dependent on them. The same is now happening in relation to information networks. The electrical network needs the information network to work, and vice versa. Technological development is changing our society in a fundamental way. This dependency is happening on our watch.",

The real problem however, is integration with existing protocols, instead of inventing something completely new and perhaps web-only.  The purpose of our work on Realm Crossover mechanisms has been to design generic solutions that extend many different application protocols, without changing their protocol specs.",
                                "description": "For clients, being able to control an online identity is not just a cool matter of adding their domain name at the end.  It also means that they control how long the identity exists, if it is an alias, if it can be a group account with members that they control.  (We made identity and access control libraries to support all that, along with identities that are only usable until a timeout, from a certain remote domain, under a particular communication topic, and so on.)\r\n\r\nFor servers, being able to authenticate users from any domain is an answer to many questions that otherwise stagnate:\r\n\r\n  * Why does every HTTP server want us to create an account under its domain, instead of letting us use our own?\r\n  * Why do we constantly need to confirm our email address by clicking links?\r\n  * Why not authenticate SMTP senders and subject others to the most stringent spam filtering?\r\n  * Why not publish a mailing list archive in IMAP, available only to subscribers and searchable with their own tooling?\r\n  * Why not use AMQP as an automation-friendly document push protocol with authenticated senders for form submission, bill processing, blog publications, document archiving, ...\r\n  * Why not share your MQTT dataflow with external parties, so they don't need to keep a web page open to be notified about, say, a newly posted document?\r\n  * Why not share your PGP keys and contact information in your own LDAP directory but with access control to decide who may see what?\r\n\r\nAll these questions stagnate on problems like *You would need to have accounts for all users in the World*.  So that is what we solved in this project.\r\n\r\nThis project expands the usefulness of many protocols by changing the way their implementations handle authentication; instead of local accounts, they follow a backlink to the client's domain.  We designed and built the extensions needed for the backend, and made a few first implementations.  We are hoping to show the usefulness of adopting these ideas in your own tooling.\r\n\r\nWe present a number of generic mechanisms for Realm Crossover:\r\n\r\n 1. SASL tokens can be relayed to a Diameter server under the domain.name;\r\n 2. Kerberos supports Realm Crossover, and a keying handshake can do this on-demand;\r\n 3. X.509 certificates and PGP keys can be assured with DANE-akin structures for clients or by a lookup in an LDAP server for domain.name.\r\n\r\nFor each, some form of domain-owned identity provider is run to assert identity when an external service needs it.  The level of security is a matter of the user and their domain.name; an external service should not have to force down the security level of the client's domain.\r\n\r\nThese three Realm Crossover mechanisms cover the majority of application protocols, the notable exceptions being the oldest ones, like Telnet, FTP and HTTP.  Specifically for HTTP, we have defined an authentication mechanism that adds SASL; this means that new security mechanisms can be defined in SASL, where it benefits many protocols; it also means that authentication shifts from the HTTP application to the server, where the coding environment is better suited for such responsibilities.\r\n\r\nWe end with a demo, showcasing a useful authentication flow:\r\n\r\n  * Client desktop, with FireFox and a HTTP-SASL plugin\r\n  * Server domain, running Apache with HTTP-SASL module under an independent domain\r\n  * Server identity client, using Diameter to relay SASL to the Client Domain\r\n  * Client Domain, running an identity provider with SASL over Diameter",

We have shipped a truck full of network equipment to Ukraine, and that was only a tiny part. Many companies and individuals from around the world have donated money, hardware and software to help the Ukrainian network operators. Everything from WiFi access points and PoE switches to be used in the bomb shelters to full-rack core routers for rebuilding their infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIn the end the logistics are the hardest part. Finding warehouses to temporarily store the donated hardware to getting help shipping equipment across borders and through complicated customs rules (network devices are dual-use goods, and convincing customs officers that a truck full of gear qualifies as humanitarian aid can be a challenge\u2026)\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ripe.net/participate/forms/uploads/fobi_plugins/file/see-10/KUC_Joint_Venture_presi_checked_final_without-OR_final_SEE10_last_vers_7f5d1683-05c2-49e1-84ca-e46d36f4dba2.pdf",

This concept helps explain how Internet governance works and why many social and legal norms, such as human rights and data protection, get resisted and subverted in the governance of the Internet infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis talk is the outcome of 6 years participation in and research of Internet governance institutions and processes, and is suitable for both issue matter experts and people who never heard of Internet governance before.",
                                "description": "The entanglement of the Internet with the daily practices of governments, companies, institutions, and individuals means that the processes that shape the Internet also shape society. For this talk, I studied the norms that shape the Internet\u2019s underlying structure through its transnational governance. Norms are the \u2018widely-accepted and internalised [sic] principles or codes of conduct that indicate what is deemed to be permitted, prohibited, or required of agents within a specific community\u2019 (Erskine and Carr 2016, 87). Internet governance is the development, coordination, and implementation of policies, technologies, protocols, and standards. Internet governance produces a global and interoperable Internet functioning as a general-purpose communication network in transnational governance bodies. I examine four cases of norm conflict and evolution in three key Internet governance institutions: the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF); the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN); and the R\u00e9seaux IP Europ\u00e9ens Network (RIPE). \r\n\r\nI show how social and legal norms evolve and are introduced, subverted, and resisted by participants in Internet governance processes with distinct and dynamic values and interests, in order to develop policies, technologies, and standards to produce an interconnected Internet. I leverage notions and insights from science and technology studies and international relations to illuminate how a sociotechnical imaginary\u2014the combination of visions, symbols, and futures that exist in groups and society\u2014architectural principles, and an entrenched norm function as instruments of metagovernance in the Internet infrastructure. This way, I demonstrate how a sociotechnical imaginary, values, and norms facilitate, instruct, and evaluate the norm setting processes in Internet governance. \r\n\r\nThis talk is empirically grounded in the analysis of mailing lists; technical documents; policy documents; interviews and the extensive observation of governance meetings. I have operationalized this analysis using the following methods: quantitative descriptive analysis; network analysis; quantitative and qualitative discourse analysis, as well as in participant observation, including semi-structured interviews and ethnographic probes.  \r\n\r\nThe aim of this talk is to show how Internet governance happening in multistakeholder bodies, what I call private Internet governance, solely functions to increase interconnection between independent networks. In this process, the introduction of social and legal norms\u2014such as human rights principles and data protection regulations that might hamper increased interconnection\u2014is resisted by significantly represented stakeholders in the process. Ultimately, I argue that while the sociotechnical imaginary and architectural principles serve to legitimize this governance ordering, the entrenched norm, what I call the infrastructural norm that transcends singular institutions, guides the distributed private governance regime. \r\n\r\nThe infrastructural norm of voluntary interconnection plays an instructing and evaluating role in the process of norm development and evolution in private Internet governance. The infrastructural norm is embedded in its institutional configuration, technological materiality, economical incentives, and supranational interest, and ties the private Internet governance regime together. In conclusion, I posit that the private Internet governance regime is designed and optimized for the narrow and limited role of increasing interconnection. As a result, the governance regime resists aligning Internet infrastructure with social or legal norms that might limit or hamper increasing interconnection.",

Guess what: They can\u2019t. Defending against hackers is a full time, complex task that requires a lot of complex tasks to be carried out in the same order and same way every time to be effective. That\u2019s difficult to do so in order to make it more doable we should try working together. CrowdSec is FOSS software that does exactly this by enabling users to share information about current attacks by parsing log files and sharing basic information (anonymously) about the attack (source ip, timestamp, IoC) with the crowd. \r\n\r\nCrowdSec could be perceived as a modern form of Fail2ban, though for Cloud and container-based infrastructure as well and capable of taking way more advanced decisions a lot faster. Mainly, it\u2019s using a decoupled and distributed approach (detect here, remedy there) and an inference engine that leverages leaky buckets, YAML & Grok patterns to identify aggressive behaviors. It acquires signals from various data sources like files, syslogd, journald, AWS Cloudwatch and Kinesis, Docker logs and Windows Event Log, normalizes them, enriches them to apply heuristics and triggers a bouncer to deal with the threat, if need be. Since it\u2019s written in Go, it\u2019s compatible with almost any environment, fast in execution and ressource conservative.\r\n\r\nTo make sure signals are generally trustworthy we\u2019ve implemented a reputation engine. Not only don\u2019t we want any false positives - we also don\u2019t want data to be poisoned. This is taken care of by a trust-ranking system where we assign a trust to each agent that will grow over time as the agent provides reliable signals. In this process both persistence and consistency is taken into account. In this process both persistence and consistency is taken into account. When an ip is voted for, it needs a certain amount of points based on the trust rank of each agent that has reported the ip. This system makes it expensive to poison collected data. Not only does it take a long time to reach a trust rank that makes any real difference - also diversity of AS NNumbers are being taken into account as well. The outcome of this is a reliable blocklist that\u2019s constantly redistributed to network members in order to achieve a form of digital herd immunity. An ip caught aggressing WordPress sites will quickly be banned by all members who subscribed to the WordPress defense collection.\r\n\r\nWhile CrowdSec is in charge of the detection, the reaction is performed by \u201cbouncers\u201d that aim to be deployable at any level of the applicative / infrastructure stack :\r\nvia nftables/iptables/pf based on an IP set \r\nvia nginx/openresty LUA scripting\r\nvia a Wordpress plugin\r\nvia a general PHP/Python/JS bouncer that works with all applications written in those languages\r\non Cloudflare or Fastly via our bouncer that integrates with the provider\u2019s API\r\non AWS WAF via our bouncer that integrates with AWS\u2019 API.\r\n.. or in many other ways. Over time the possibilities will increase as the application design basically supports anything. \r\n\r\nBouncers can enforce several types of remediations, like blocking, sending a captcha, notifying, lowering rights, speed, sending a 2FA request, etc.\r\n\r\nThis approach, combined with a declarative configuration and a stateless behavior, makes it an efficient tool to enhance the security of modern stacks (containers, k8s, serverless and more generally automatically deployed infrastructures).\r\n\r\nWe are committed to building a strong community, with all that it implies :\r\na public hub to find, share and amend parsers, scenarios, and blockers\r\npermissive open-source license (MIT) to stay business-friendly\r\nand overall a strong commitment to transparency and community-first mentality, by tooling and behavior\r\n\r\nIn my talk I will dig into the technical nitty-gritty part of CrowdSec, the architecture and concepts and focus specifically on how we managed to collect data from live Log4J exploitation attempts using the crowd and how efficient this strategy turned out to be. CrowdSec is still collecting data and tracking the result on https://crowdsec.net/log4j-tracker/\r\n\r\nThe bigger the CrowdSec community becomes, the better protection against cyber criminals. So I really want to inspire the audience to engage in CrowdSec either by installing and using the software, to contribute documentation or code - or all of them. For the good of everybody!\r\n\r\nCurrently CrowdSec is collecting data from more than 45.000 agents in 158 countries. Each day more than 3M signals are collected. Over the last more than a year over 2.4M malevolent ips have been detected and verified.",

Did work with refugee women as well as work-related to women's rights on/offline and Laury Love case Naomi Colvin. \r\n\r\nCurrently, I work as a psychotherapist. My work is focused on social media's influence on the \u201ccreation of opinion\u201d related to various topics such as self-worth, politics, activism, and isolation (to name a few). The struggle to keep afloat while suffering burnout and identity crisis. How we perceive interactions inside our algorithmically generated bubbles and struggle to find the right tool to bypass those on the right-wing \u201cTrump\u201d train while seeking authenticity.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of alleged activism, I myself went through a massive 2-year depression, the road out of which was quite a turmoil. I have seen similar situations happen to my dearest friends many of whom left IT altogether or disassociated completely with their online personas and communities. Some we just sadly lost along the way\u2026 Perhaps you reading this, can relate.\r\n\r\nI feel that this area of Hacktivism is not spoken about often and wish to share my story, observations, and some tools for those who might relate to the subject matter. It could be a lecture or a workshop depending on the availability of space and time that could be allocated.\r\n\r\nIt would be grand if it could be a \u201clecture\u201d the second part of which could be a discussion, which is a format I did at CCC on a similar subject matter but more oriented toward \u201cpolitics\u201d.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and effort to create this event and keep us all connected.\r\n\r\nWith gratitude,\r\nSonia",

                                "description": "Earth is a pretty complicated system, consisting of numerous sub-systems operating at different time and energy scales. All the systems are strongly coupled. These include the atmosphere, oceans, freshwater, cryosphere and biosphere, all of which can be further subdivided by various schemes. \r\n\r\nThe problems facing people trying to model these systems are numerous: there's a lot of data, all of it is bad, most of the code is written in Fortran, and all of it is horribly slow.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, modeling Earth is computationally intractable without some simplifying assumptions. For instance, if your global grid for weather prediction has \"pixels\" that represent more than 16km\u00b2, the physical parameterization can't \"see\" convection, so you miss most storms. And yet somehow people manage.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll start with a brief introduction to how some Earth systems work, describe some parameterizations, and then look at different free software/open source models operating under different domains, assumptions, and scales. Finally, we'll do a quick review of some of the many places where there is room for improvement.",

                                "description": "Since the beginning of Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian society was quickly polarized. The government started to control the discours about war and silence all kinds of alternative narratives and opposition voices. The anti-war movement quickly found itself in deep underground and in high-risk, with more than 10 000 arrests during rallies against the war and hundreds new criminal cases against those who dare to speak out the truth about Russian army atrocities committed in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThis talk is based on my own experience as a member of anti-war resistance, and as a Russian girl married to a Ukrainian guy. We have just escaped from Russia to western Europe. \r\n\r\nApart from being an activist, I am involved in the scene of digital security and secure messaging since 2016, working with the team of Delta Chat messenger as a UX-researcher, and studying usage of secure messaging apps in high-risk areas such as Ukraine, Belarus, Syria, Iran and so on. I have recently published a book based on 4 years of fieldwork entitled \"Concealing for Freedom. The making of encryption and online civil liberties\" that traces recent history of most famous end-to-end encrypted messaging apps and their usages in at-risk areas.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I would like to describe the current state of Russian surveillance technologies and practices used to prosecute and identify anti-war activists. I will also describe how the war affected Internet governance and Internet censorship in Russia and what are the consequences for the opposition, media and civil society. I will share my analysis of user patterns in terms of digital self defense, namely, growing interest in decentralized, p2p or federated messaging alternatives as opposed to centralized ones. \r\n\r\nMy talk will be structured not so much as an academic presentation but rather as a set of stories from the field. And I would like to use half of the time for an active discussion with the audience about how to help those who stayed inside Russia and try to oppose the war. What tools and what tactics could we recommend them?",

Lawyers' associations in Italy and Croatia report hundreds of nuisance suits being laid against journalists. In Hungary, Poland and Slovenia, the state and its allies are SLAPPing opponents - journalists, anticorruption activists, LGBTI+ rights advocates - with impunity.\r\n\r\nLitigation has been turned against the activist community, oligarchs try to silence debate and  Eastern Europe has become the new home of SLAPP-based oppression, as politics slide into autocracy and leaders stamp down on dissent.\r\n\r\nBlueprint is part of an 11-country coalition working on the ground to train lawyers to help the victims of SLAPPs strike back. We're currently developing a curriculum from scratch, drawing on European human rights principles and local knowledge.\r\n\r\nIf you want to understand the European situation better, or if you have experience of SLAPPS and can help us understand what kinds of legal training and other defences are useful to civil society, we'd love for you to join this conversation.",

Luckily the number of successful attacks that truly targeted ICS environments are scarce. At the same time this industry faces some difficult challenges, such as high availability requirements, old technology and a low security maturity.\r\n\r\nPwn2Own Miami is an annual edition of the Pwn2Own competition, that focuses solely on ICS applications. Targets range from OPC UA implementations (on of the main communication protocol in ICS), to data gateways and SCADA systems. They challenge competitors to find zero-days attacks against any of the targets. Participants need to demonstrate their zero-days by compromising a target machine running the latest version of the application.\r\n\r\nLast year we participated in the Pwn2Own Austin edition, which focused on Enterprise applications, with a zero-day chain against the Zoom client. This year we decided to participate in the ICS edition. It was a close race, but ultimately we beat the competing teams and won this year's edition. We demonstrated 3 RCE's, one DoS and an interesting certificate verification bypass, which in total was good for 90 points and $90,000.",

He obviously has low-privileged access to his own laptop/workstation, which has been carefully hardened using modern endpoint protections such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, BitLocker and Secure Boot. Nowadays, central management of these tools is a must to ease the management of all the company\u2019s workstations. This is the ideal target for a malicious insider to gain local administrative access over his laptop.\r\n\r\nWe want to show you a proof of concept where a malicious insider can gain administrative access within 10 minutes while only having access to his BitLocker recovery key, managed by Microsoft Intune & Azure Active Directory, defeating all the workstation\u2019s hardening measures in place. We will start with a real attack scenario that was part of one of our red team engagements and explain the steps we took to obtain local administrative privileges on the end user\u2019s workstation. \r\n\r\nWe start by showing how a malicious insider can retrieve the BitLocker recovery key. Then, we bypass the default Secure Boot configuration to boot into an alternative operating system. This allows us to decrypt the BitLocker encrypted hard drive and use tools to gain control over the built-in local Administrator account.\r\n\r\nA thorough explanation including defensive measures are part of this talk as well.",
                                "description": "This presentation is divided in 3 sections. \r\n\r\nFirst we are going to explain our attack scenario. Here, as a malicious insider, we have access our own user account and our own company-managed laptop. Since we are a new employee, we get the laptop configuration that the IT team of the company uses for every new laptop that is deployed in the company\u2019s IT landscape. They know their business; they make use of an Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) solution by Microsoft: Defender for Endpoint. Next to that, they configured BitLocker on their endpoints to prevent an attacker getting physical access to the laptop\u2019s hard drive and being able to extract unencrypted data from the laptop. To be sure that no malicious USB sticks with Kali Linux can be used to bypass security measures on the laptop, they enable Secure Boot in the UEFI settings. Of course, they put an administrator password on the UEFI settings to prevent someone from altering the UEFI settings & simply disabling Secure Boot.\r\n\r\nSecond, we will talk about how centrally managed cloud native services such as Microsoft Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Intune are working together to ease the management of endpoints in a company\u2019s IT landscape. While a low-privileged user is blocked from accessing most of the management portals for these services, he can still access a platform where he is able to retrieve his BitLocker recovery key. This is called the BitLocker self-service portal. In a default configuration, a user can use this portal to retrieve his BitLocker recovery key without needing to have approval of IT to retrieve it. We now have access to the BitLocker recovery key and a well-secured company-managed endpoint device. What could go wrong?\r\n\r\nIn the third section, we show how a default Secure Boot configuration allows a malicious insider, or attacker, can still boot into an alternative Linux operating system because the bootloader is signed by Microsoft itself! This allows the operating system to pass the Secure Boot check. Then, we can install malicious tools on this alternative Linux operating system to be able to interact with the BitLocker-encrypted built-in hard drive. Since we have the recovery key, we can easily decrypt and mount the Windows partition on this hard drive. Since we have full access to the operating system (remember, we\u2019re root) we can use tools to modify the SAM database on the hard drive \u2013 this is where local users of the Windows installation are managed. This way, we can enable the local built-in Administrator account and set his password to an empty password! We write it to the hard drive, reboot to Windows et voila, we have administrative access over the laptop. We could even take it as far as adding exclusions to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint \u2013 essentially disabling it for that endpoint.\r\n\r\nDuring the talk, we will give a live demo, cover defensive measures that can be taken to hinder a malicious insider\u2019s malintent and further cover the impact this attack might have in a corporate environment.",

At that time, he did not yet know where he would end up, but he knew it would have something to do with cyber security.\r\n\r\nAfter his studies, Wiebe began his career as a consultant at the Belgian Cyber Security team at EY. He was asked to perform penetration tests, but was also mainly part of the defensive blue team. This enabled him to gain offensive & defensive security experience in a broad number of areas, such as:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tInfrastructure penetration tests\r\n\u2022\tPurple team assessments\r\n\u2022\tWeb application penetration tests\r\n\u2022\tPhishing assessments\r\n\u2022\tSIEM rules engineering & configuration\r\n\u2022\tSecurity Automation & Orchestration (SOAR)\r\n\r\nUsing the experience gained during his time at EY, he evolved to a pure penetration testing, red team & adversary emulation role at NVISO, a European Cyber Security Services company. There, he applies most of the tactics, techniques & procedures used in the MITRE ATT&CK framework to assess and improve the general security posture of NVISO\u2019s clients.\r\n\r\nNext to Cyber Security, Wiebe also has a particular interest in music, cars & sports. He is nothing near a rockstar guitar player, but he fancies a good jam when there is one \u2013 even though he only recently started playing guitar. He mainly loves watching cars, but the technology behind modern cars is of course related to his general interest in IT. He registers his occasional kilometres on his racing bike on Strava as well.\r\n\r\nWiebe is always open for a talk \u2013 if you see him, come say hi!",

                                "description": "In his seminal work [\"The ecosystem is moving\"](https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/), Moxie Marlinspike laid out clearly the reasons why it's impossible to do what [Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)), or [the Fediverse](https://fediverse.party/), or for that matter the Web, have done: create a dynamic, quickly-evolving ecosystem without centralizing it.\r\n\r\nFor years, as a person responsible for information security of at-risk reporters and their sources, I have been advocating Signal as a secure Internet messaging service. And with good reasons.\r\n\r\nCriticizing a security-sensitive tool like Signal is tricky, as it might be misconstrued as a call to abandon it, and move to alternatives that might be in fact worse. But here, at a hacker conference and with little risk of causing confusion and diverting users towards less secure platforms, can we please have an honest conversation about Signal's problems? And how 5 years after that blogpost, moxie's centralization has not solved them?..\r\n\r\nThere are good reasons to exert a level of control over what connects to a communication network. But effectively shutting out a community of developers that would love to implement Signal clients [for](https://gitlab.com/rubdos/whisperfish) [less](https://open-store.io/app/textsecure.nanuc) [popular](https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=8505) [OSes](https://forums.puri.sm/t/how-can-you-install-signal-on-the-librem-5/10244) (many of which happen to attract the kind of infosec-aware crowd that used to be the core pushers of Signal) is not a good outcome.\r\n\r\nOpening up more on the client side and providing some form of independent client development program (starting with a stable API) would already help a ton. Even if it's just the desktop client that gets re-written in something that is not in essence a packaged browser [trailing it's upstream on security patches](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22239791).\r\n\r\nFinally, we need to talk federation. Does it make moving fast and breaking things more difficult? Yes, yes it does, and that can be a good thing. It also makes the resulting federated service more resilient (one [service provider experiencing issues](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/signal-users-globally-experiencing-issues-company-working-on-a-fix-1759524-2021-01-15) does not bring the whole network down).

It helps people to regain or improve their health, cope with a permanent condition or analyze their vital stats? That\u2019s fantastic! What could possibly go wrong?\r\n\r\nHistory has shown that faults in medical devices can have disastrous consequences. Those products may cause severe injury, permanent damage, even death. In order to make sure that your product does not harm its users there is a bunch of regulations that you have to comply with. How does this affect your work? \r\n\r\nFirst we\u2019ll take a look at where to find software in or around medical devices from embedded code to stand-alone sofware with AI. Then I\u2019ll provide a few infamous examples of what went wrong (including a great talk about faulty software in pacemakers from CCC Camp 2019 \u2013 you know, that last great event before THE VIRUS).\r\n\r\nThen we\u2019ll talk about the regulatory part, especially at the EU Medical Device Regulation and what it means for planning, implementing and maintaining software for medical products (my favourite topic: traceability. ;-) ). It\u2019s also of interest for non-EU participants because many of the regulations are ISO-harmonized.",

However, in the last couple years we have also observed the inverse: simple attacks where actors with varying levels of skill and few resources gain access to software and interfaces that control physical processes. These compromises appear to be driven by ideological, egotistical, or financial objectives, taking advantage of an ample supply of internet-connected cyber physical systems. This is sometimes concerning, for example when it is affects panels for controlling processes in a water facilities or manufacturing processes. Sometimes, though, it is absurd, such as when the critical systems actors claim to compromise are in fact toys or domestic appliances. In this talk, we will share a series of stories of success and failure involving low sophistication compromises on cyber physical systems. We will describe the different types of cases we have observed, what the actors did, and how you can reproduce them for good. At last, we will discuss to what extent these crimes of opportunity represent a risk to cyber physical systems and what we can do about it.",

For this event - NoHat - I focused on sharing the stories of low sophistication compromises we observed involving software used to control physical processes. However, for MCH I did some modifications in the title and the presentation itself to share not only the cases, but also how to reproduce them for good.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this talk is to share with the audience how actors without necessarily a lot of skills or resources are using very simple tools to hack cyber physical systems. I will do some experiments to show very quick results the audience can get reproducing these techniques so that they learn how to find these internet-connected cyber physical assets and notify the owners.\r\n\r\nThe outline of the initial presentation was:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIntroduction\r\no\tStory: Hacked kitchen was supposed to be a gas system\r\n\u2022\tDefine low sophistication cyber physical compromises\r\n\u2022\t(De)evolution of cyber physical threats\r\no\tFrom state-sponsored to financial, and now opportunistic\r\n\u2022\tDescribe low sophistication compromises of cyber physical systems\r\no\tDistribution and claims of exposed systems\r\no\tSeeming actor motivations\r\no\tCommon actor techniques\r\no\tTypes of evidence (or lack of)\r\n\u2022\tLow Sophistication Threat Actors Access HMIs and Manipulate Control Processes\r\no\tOldsmar, Florida modified HMI on water facility\r\no\tIsrael\u2019s advisory on compromises to water facility systems\r\no\tSolar energy and dam surveillance system\r\no\tHotel BAS\r\n\u2022\tAmateur Actors Show Limited OT Expertise\r\no\t\u201cTrain control system\u201d was in fact a human resources tool\r\no\tSecond \u201ctrain control system\u201d controls toy trains\r\no\tWebsite leaks claiming access to SCADA systems\r\n\u2022\tHacktivist and Researcher Tutorials\r\no\tTwo hacktivist groups share tutorials for finding and compromising cyber physical systems\r\no\tResearchers have done too \u2013 including a couple examples, such as a recent script to identify tank gauges\r\n\u2022\tDoes this activity pose an actual risk to cyber physical systems?\r\no\tEach incident provides threat actors with opportunities to learn more about OT, such as the underlying technology, physical processes, and operations.\r\no\tEven low-sophistication intrusions into OT environments carry the risk of disruption to physical processes, mainly in the case of industries or organizations with less mature security practices.\r\no\tThe publicity of these incidents normalizes cyber operations against OT and may encourage other threat actors to increasingly target or impact these systems.\r\n\u2022\tOn the bright side\u2026\r\no\tThere are safety methods in place that stop immediate computer instructions from modifying actual physical processes\r\n\uf0a7\tEngineering and human processes\r\n\uf0a7\tMissing security on the software side\r\n\r\nAdditional Materials:\r\nPlease find in this link our recent blog on this topic: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/05/increasing-low-sophistication-operational-technology-compromises.html",

                                "description": "Face search engines like [Clearview AI](https://reclaimyourface.eu/how-to-reclaim-your-face-from-clearview-ai/) and [Pimeyes](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/04/tech/pimeyes-facial-recognition/index.html) have all our faces and process our biometric data. They didn't ask us if we like their *service* and if they may use our data. Users of these search engines can now identify us anytime, anywhere.\r\n\r\nSince biometric data enjoy special protection under GDPR, we filed complaints in multiple European states. We report how data protection authorities did nothing for a long time and tell of the first successes. However, it became clear that GDPR does not protect against biometric surveillance.\r\n\r\nThat's why we have joined forces to form the **[Reclaim Your Face](https://reclaimyourface.eu/)** campaign. Together, we call on the European Commission to strictly regulate the use of biometric technilogies in order to avoid undue interference with fundamental rights. In particular, we ask the Commission to prohibit, in law and in practice, indiscriminate or arbitrarily-targeted uses of biometrics which can lead to unlawful mass surveillance.\r\n\r\nThe two face search engines are not the only examples of everyday biometric surveillance. However, it is difficult to track where else we are being monitored: There is a lack of transparency and oversight. Public authorities and private companies rarely report on their own what they have been up to. We share how we've used FOIA requests, among other things, to create a little more publicity.",

But stalkerware is not what I encounter most when I get contacted by stalking victims. Almost anyone can become a victim of stalking; stalkers do not just target celebrities. Sometimes they are ex-partners known to the victim, other times they may be a casual acquaintance, or just a simple stranger. With stalkerware, the actor needs access to the device or needs to persuade the victim to install something. In cases where the stalker is a (ex-)partner, that might be doable. But in other cases, it is easier to gain access to the accounts of the victim, gather information about the victim from social media, or use tracking devices (looking at you Apple and Tile) to follow the victim. Tech companies develop new apps and gadgets seemingly without thinking about other ways these can be used. And they end up making it easier to stalk someone. But what can we do about this problem? Should we lower efforts hunting stalkerware and help victims gather evidence? Or can we do something else.",

Plus: Why we need user-centered technology with privacy and encryption.",
                                "description": "Apps are convenient. You just download them, use them and and they make your life easier. Most of the time. But most of the apps that are developed have different goals than you might think: And that\u2019s not making your life easier, but grabbing as much data from you as you and sell that data to data brokers and get money out of it. \r\n\r\nNothing new, you say? Common practice since years! It\u2019s your own fault using such an app, just stop it! Well, that\u2019s too easy! We need a technology swap. We need user-centered apps, open source, but with privacy and encryption.\r\n\r\nBut let me explain all this to you with an example that is currently in the media and shows how deep and dangerous the problem can become - from one day to another. A draft opinion from the Supreme Court indicates that in the US the constitutional right to an abortion might fall. And here we come to the topic: A lot of people - all around the world - use period-tracking apps. The data that is collected by those apps can be used against them, because the apps know when your last period was, how regular or unregular your menstruation cycle is. Some apps even collect data about you having unprotected sex! Those data can be used against us. \r\n\r\nIn this talk you will learn what data menstruation apps usually collect, how they are financed, what is happening with your data, and what you should be aware of when using those apps. I also talk about alternatives - yes, there are some! Some app developers think further and do provide the right solutions for this problem. Also I draw attention to the question on whether users of these apps in the US who instantly delete the data and the apps from their smartphones are just super-sensitive, or it\u2019s the best decision they can do!",

Some of the standards are extremely cursed, some are extremely old, most are both. We'll also cover more recent developments in the domain space, such as the move from WHOIS to RDAP, and improvements in DNSSEC deployment.\r\n\r\nAnd finally after all that if you decide that somehow this is something you want more of in your life we'll give some pointers for how one might setup their own registrar, especially if they want to take greater control of their own domains, or just have some fun.",

                                "description": "As the first Covid lockdown made it impossible to continue hosting live events in pubs, many presenters and questioneers quickly adapted to hosting online quizzes. Slightly depressed by the notion that online quizzes would involve a great amount of cheating and the thought that participants would see it as an \u201cokay substitute for the offline version\u201d, I choose to develop an online event that would be impossible to cheat and would give people a unique experience, whilst still being a game that can also be played in pubs.\r\n\r\nWhen this presentation is held, there will have been at least 200 installments of DJ Cone Yo\u2019s online Discobingo, with over 5.000 participants on all 6 continents, all from a laptop on a nightstand next to my bed. It proved to be an event accessible to both Children as well as high-level employees of companies such as Deloitte, PWC, Gemeente Amsterdam, and then some.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this will not be a presentation on any personal accomplishment with this event. Because let\u2019s be honest: it\u2019s a guy doing digital conga shuffles in front of the webcam. However, during the development of this activity I learned how to build up an https online radio server with Icecast2, created calculation models in excel to manufacture unique cards, optimized this data to supply me predictive data to rapidly check results, and created a way to supply participants with all information, including unique cards, whilst living up to GDPR-standards. With this presentation I\u2019d like to provide some inspiration regarding how to develop each of these things without any knowledge of programming and using some of the most basic pieces of software. Also: share the joy of bingo math.\r\n\r\nThere is an option to also do a shared evening activity. People can supply songs for an evening discobingo which can be played in multiple locations at the same time. So if there are any restrictions still set, the radio stream can be played in tents or in smaller groups, and everyone that wishes to join can receive a unique card and play along. In the spirit of the event, people can even submit their own prizes to the bingo as to share them with others at the festival.\r\n\r\nAnd on a personal note:\r\nAfter visiting SHA2017 back when I was working as a campaign strategist for Bits of Freedom (where I got to design campaigns such as the Rijksveiligheidsdienst) I have thought about how amazing it would be to do a presentation at one of these events. Back then, me and a few colleagues specifically enjoyed a presentation on \u201chow to start an escape room\u201d. Doing something along these lines and sharing insights gained from developing entertainment is something I am good at.",

The digital realm is becoming more and more important in all of our lives. That is why we are starting a research project on what digital civil  disobedience might look like. This is something else than mere \u2018clicktivism\u2019.. What are the differences and similarities of online and offline civil disobedience? Is a mass action blocking the doorway of a bank similar an Ddos attack when done openly and with a clear political and peaceful goal? Is dropping a banner from a building the same as defacing a website? At MCH2022 Greenpeace wants to start the discussion, look at possibilities, and brainstorm about this topic.

At Greenpeace we know our strength and our weaknesses when doing actions in physical spaces. We scale buildings and hang banners, we have blocked the petrol harbour in Rotterdam (multiple times) and we stop oil/gas rigs from operating. All these kinds of actions are part of a struggle for a healthy climate and safe planet to live on and so ideologically motivated. \r\n\r\nThe right to protest is a fundamental European right, a right that is very dear to us and important when chased by the law. At Greenpeace we always look at new ways to do disobedient actions. This is why we started a research on how online actions can contribute to campaigns. The last few months we have been looking into the possibilities of digital civil disobedience actions. We looked at the risks, the actions and the possibilities it will bring. One thing we learned is that everyone we talk to about this topic is super excited.\r\n\r\nDuring MCH2022 we want to talk more about digital civil disobedience and what it would look like.

Because a museum is a terrible businessplan I decided to create a few services, like repairs, selling overstock and reading old media. For this could not be done by one person, I decided to have people with autism help me by simply not putting a label on them. The businessplan was created and eventually a building was rented. The entire museum is physically built in 7 days (not even kidding) and we were off to a very rough start and even balancing on the edge of bankruptcy. However, we managed to stay afloat and we even moved to a much better and bigger building where we enjoyed for a full month before corona hit the museum. As an unsubsidized museum and without big sponsors we were faced a brand new challenge. But we overcame and grew stronger than ever.... (and then there's plenty of story to tell more).",

Fundamental rights, like the privacy, freedom and sovereignty of children, parents and educators are insufficiently secured. Ed-tech is mainly closed source and full of vendor lockins.

And our coalition for fair digital education is going to do it.",
                                "description": "Private companies do not have the same interests as public institutions like schools. Schools do not have the time, knowledge or budget to hack their own IT environment together. Hence, BigTech and Ed-Tech fix this problem for schools, by offering services that have a very low price tag in euro's, but the actual payment is in data: meta data, \"service\"-data and user-data. DPIA you say? *(Detailed Privacy Impact Analysis)* That will achieve sort-of-legally compliant services at max. If only the authorities would actually bite, but alas, enforcement is lax, and four years of GDPR and the IT environment in schools is still riddled with privacy risks. Essential online services are out-of-scope of the DPIA's and purposes like \"product improvement\" (read: feeding AI and machine learning algorithms) is GDPR-Okay. If you or your kid goes to a 'Google school' and is forced to use a Chromebook, you'll be producing data to train Google, and you will be trained to love Google services. Consequently children won't develop core digital skills or a critical attitude toward digital services.\r\n\r\nThus, there is a huge gap between core values of big tech companies versus public values in the educational system. Therefore, enforcement to make Big Tech embrace those public values will never be effective. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bThat is why we need to build a school IT environment based upon public values: transparent, open source, privacy-by-design, decentralized, fair and respecting our digital sovereignty. Our coalition for fair digital education is going to build this. This is a huge project and a lot of work, so join us.",

                                "description": "The security of telemetric medical devices is critical to good patient care [3]. Recent research has described security breaches of implanted medical devices in the context of diabetes (insulin pumps) and cardiology (cardiac defibrillators), however this has not been described in the field of neurology [1-2]. In our workshop we discuss the security vulnerabilities of \u2018Deep Brain Stimulator\u2019 (DBS) devices that are currently used in healthcare practice for a range of medical conditions.\r\n\r\nOur work revolves around a recent clinical case that we encountered in our hospital. A patient presented to our Emergency Department with acute neurological symptoms, which were found to be related to his malfunctioning Deep Brain Stimulator (DBS). As doctors, this was our first encounter with such a case and it posed difficult medical and technological challenges. A number of similar cases, in which patients with malfunctioning DBS devices have presented with abnormal medical symptoms, have been reported in the wider literature. Increasingly, these devices are being monitored remotely by specialists centers and the telemetric nature of these devices leaves them open to malicious hacks. \r\n\r\nMore than 100,000 patients worldwide have received Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for neurological conditions. The adoption of \u2018neurotechnology\u2019 or \u2018brain-computer interfaces\u2019 has increased across the medical domain for neurological conditions (e.g. Parkinsons), but also for \u2018emerging indications\u2019 including OCD, Depression and Bipolar disorder. Additionally, beyond the healthcare space, \u2018brain chips\u2019 are receiving increasing attention for their promise to enhance cognition, augment reality and manage emotions.\r\n\r\nHacking brain stimulators (\u2018brain jacking\u2019) has so far only been reported in theory [1-3]. Targeted attacks of telemetric DBS devices to affect voltage/current and frequency settings could induce impairment of motor function, alteration of impulse control, induction of pain and manipulation of emotions [1-3]. The ability of hackers to exert malicious control over brain implants has dangerous and potentially life threatening consequences. For our patients and the wider community, we want to understand these threats and develop protective measures to secure the neuro-integrity of our patients.\r\n\r\nRecognising and responding to hacks of deep brain devices requires an interdisciplinary response. We need data scientists and hackers who understand the vulnerabilities of telemetric systems and potential routes of tech-induced harm. We need medical physicians and neuroanatomists to understand the clinical syndromes that may arise from the intersection of human physiology and digital manipulation. The workshop will start with a presentation describing the medical case of DBS failure. Following this, we invite participants to brainstorm ideas for how a DBS system could be hacked and to consider the ethical issues of this research. We will divide the audience into small groups and ask them to consider the following questions:\r\n\r\nQuestions for workshop participants would include\r\n(i) Vulnerabilities: How would you hack a telemetric DBS device? What attacks is it likely to encounter? What are its vulnerabilities?\r\n(ii) Defense: What options could improve the security of these devices? \r\n(iii) Ethics: What are the arguments for and against these devices being used in healthcare? \r\n\r\nFollowing group discussions we will reconvene and share our thoughts and recommendations. We invite people from all disciplinary backgrounds to attend and share their thoughts on potential vulnerabilities and solutions for these systems.\r\n\r\n**Key References\r\n[1] Pycroft, Laurie, et al. \u2018Brainjacking: Implant Security Issues in Invasive Neuromodulation\u2019.

                                "description": "Telemetric medical devices can enhance patient care by improving symptom detection and disease treatment through the delivery of timely and responsive interventions (e.g., wireless glucose monitoring devices for diabetic patients). Yet, the increasing adoption of wireless medical devices in healthcare settings and the consumer environment puts patients at risk of \u2018healthcare hacks\u2019. \r\n\r\nWe present a number of wireless medical devices currently in use and ask you to consider the vulnerabilities of these technologies to hack attacks:\r\n1. Diabetes glucose sensors\r\n2. Hearing aids\r\n3. Cardiac Monitors\r\n4. Pain relief voltage devices\r\n5. Virtual Patient Beds\r\n\r\nEach of these devices connect remotely to a monitoring device, exposing them to malicious digital manipulation. So far, two case studies have described the vulnerabilities of these systems. One report described the remote hijacking of an insulin pump and another described the manipulation of an implanted cardiac device [1-3]. Increasingly, research is describing the security and privacy risks of telemetric and implanted medical devices to patients. In particular, \u2018closed loop\u2019 systems that alter device settings based on real-time physiological signals do not require clinician or patient input, and are therefore particularly vulnerable to unnoticed manipulation. Without proper security, smart medical devices are breachable and can have life-threatening consequences for the patient. \r\n\r\nWe invite you to our workshop to discuss, in short groups, the listed devices and their vulnerability to manipulation.  As medical doctors, we will highlight the range of clinical syndromes which may arise from these hacks and will discuss how they may be recognised in clinical settings. \r\n\r\nLastly, we will consider the vulnerability of the healthcare concept of \u2018The Virtual Patient\u2019. Due to high hospital occupancy following the COVID19 pandemic, \u2018Virtual Beds\u2019 - which allow physicians to monitor patients in the community - have been suggested as an alternative policy for relieving pressure from healthcare services. The management of the \u2018virtual patient\u2019 relies heavily on telemetry devices and medical database systems. We will discuss the vulnerability of the specific devices listed above, in addition to the wider concept of \u2018virtual patient care\u2019.\r\n\r\nQuestions for workshop participants would include:\r\n(i) Vulnerabilities: How would you hack a smart medical device or what attacks is it likely to encounter? \r\n(ii) Defense: What are device vulnerabilities and what options could improve the security of these devices? \r\n(iii) Ethics: What are the arguments for and against these devices being used in healthcare? \r\n\r\n[1] Denning, Tamara, et al. \u2018Neurosecurity: Security and Privacy for Neural Devices\u2019.

A human at their worst mental state, is going to interact with a system in drastically different ways than a human at their best. How can technologists design new systems with these psychological vulnerabilities that many humans have in mind? In this workshop, we\u2019ll be using a systems innovation, design and psychology lens to demonstrate practical frameworks to addressing the how.",
                                "description": "There\u2019s a growing awareness in Western society about the negative impacts that technology has on our lives. Parallel to that, there is a growing acknowledgement that mental health and wellbeing is important. But for any prominent change to happen in a positive direction, these discourses cannot stay evolving in parallel - they need to come together and inform each other. \u2028\u2028Trauma and its impacts on human psychology are an all-pervasive force that impact humans on a micro and macro level. It only makes sense that the same force would replicate itself in technology. From the alarming rate of depression in social media use to addictive and detrimental financial decision-making in cryptocurrency trading, technology has a significant impact on human behaviour, melding in and perpetuating pre-existing vulnerabilities we have. \u2028\u2028But how would we map this complex, slightly abstract idea out in a practical way? What would a trauma-informed system look like? Or may we dare to dream of moving forward from being stuck in cycles of trauma? Using a systems-innovation framework, paired with a value-driven design lens and an understanding of trauma from research and our own journeys in it, we\u2019d like to share with you a multidisciplinary design lens that acknowledges trauma as a significant actor within it. \u2028\u2028The workshop will include our a recollection of own experiences in the climate innovation, humanitarian sector and decentralised technology field. We will invite participants to reflect upon how they interact within systems, mapping out the relationship between complexity and unintended psychological consequences, and how to ultimately re-imagine a different world.",

In this session, we will come together, interact, go through a bunch of skillfully crafted activities and draw conclusions on what's the real state of our virtual lives? Which humane components are lacking? What extra aspects have been added? How is it affecting our bonding, privacy, individuality, organization, and dialogue?",

Thereby identifying the gaps and ineffectual features of social media focusing on how social media is affecting our bonding, privacy, individuality, organization, and dialogue.\r\n\r\nChanneling in our high spirits, we'd attempt to redesign the interface that can connect people across the globe in a more human manner.\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: Attendees need to have at least one active social media account (LinkedIn/Twitter/Facebook/Instagram etc) and bring along their mobile phones with internet connectivity :)",

He then completed his PhD in Atomic and Laser Physics at the University of Oxford (2016). In his PhD he studied the interactions of quantum light with trapped cold atomic gases and developed theoretical models for the resulting competition between measurement back-action and intrinsic atomic dynamics.\r\n\r\nFollowing his PhD studies, Wojciech decided that he would rather dive into Computer Science. Therefore, rather than following an academic career he went to work as a software engineer in the network protocols team at Metaswitch in London. It is here that he developed his interest in computer networks. During his time in industry, Wojciech was able to learn the basic theory of operation of computer networks whilst gaining practical experience in implementing and running network software.\r\n\r\nWojciech found out about QuTech while attending the IETF 101 meeting in London where the Quantum Internet Research Group at the IRTF was formed. Less than a year later, in February 2019 Wojciech joined QuTech as a postdoc in the Wehner Group. His research work focused on quantum network protocol design and the software architecture for quantum networking nodes. In the meantime he also became a co-chair of the Quantum Internet Research Group at the IRTF. As of April 2021, Wojciech is a Quantum Network Engineer at QuTech. In his new role he works on developing the overall software architecture for quantum networks covering both the data and control plane.",

It is often called 'the wikipedia of maps' and is getting used in more and more applications - from grassroot movements to big corporations. But it can be confusing to dive into the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll give a high-level overview of OpenStreetMap and answer the most important questions:\r\n\r\n- What is OpenStreetMap (and what is it not?)\r\n- What applications exist?\r\n- What tools exist?\r\n- How can one contriute?\r\n- How can one export data?\r\n- How can one get in touch with the local mapping community?\r\n\r\nNo previous experience with mapping or GIS needed! This is a talk, so you don't have to bring anything. However, if you need some help with your first OSM-edits, I'll stick around after the talk to get you started. In that case, it might be useful to bring your laptop (or smartphone)",

Notice that running Linux is the best way to fully benefit from Gopass, but MacOS and Windows are also (somewhat) supported. Please, if you have one (even already in use for something else), bring your Yubikey 4+ with you, since you can easily increase your password store's security using it.\r\n\r\nYou can also come if you'd like to enhance your existing password store setup, or if you need help migrating your existing password store over to Gopass.",

It's going to work. You will learn how to make your hands not shake at all ever. You will learn how to activate your builtin precision positioning superpowers.\r\n\r\nFor people afraid of surface mount assembly/rework. You know those tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you how!\r\n\r\nThink you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s? Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no longer need to be scared of SMD.

Our coders build super nice projects and are the ultimate example that technology can be fun.  \r\nWe have one rule: **\"Above all: be cool!\"**.\r\n\r\n### Practical Information:\r\n\r\nThis workshop is for girls and boys age 7-18 (experience with Scratch will give you a headstart, others will get a quick Scratch Intro).   \r\nIf you are younger than 12, you are best accompanied by a parent.  \r\nParents can stick around for the sparkling atmosphere and to help volunteering.  \r\nWe bring different robotics: \r\n- Makeblock Mbot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hQtdYd5i-Y\r\n- Makeblock Mbot 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxpoP175mOU\r\n- Makeblock Ultimate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noutjGbBF2U\r\n- Grove https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqsObxK0wDM\r\n- Ozobot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm_H8HXWFZ4\r\n- Makey Makey https://youtu.be/70Ykn2k5LOg\r\n- Microbit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuza5WXiMkc\r\n- Microbit with Maqueen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sAHwsOEKsg\r\n\r\nIt is a **must** if parents **join half an hour before the end** to attend **the show and tell**.\r\n\r\nYou can bring a laptop.

This talk concerns Chinese vendors of ankle monitors - but the processes are applicable to different brands and types as well. I will discuss how I developed a server which can be used with 4 vendors of these devices - and how I got the protocol documents for each of them through a bit of social engineering.\r\n\r\nThe focus will be on the technical details of how your location is determined - which fallbacks are used in case locating falls - and how data is communicated to the server - and the security implications of all of this.

                                "description": "In 2020, when the pandemic started, scientists suggested to also digitally support fighting the pandemic. One of the suggestions was digitally supported contact tracing. After first asking the market for solutions the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport decided to self build open, privacy friendly, secure and accessible solutions with help of a large open source community.\r\n\r\nWhen vaccinations became available and timeframes for building solutions were near impossible the next step was clear: get hackers involved. This isn\u2019t just to stick to the values, but also to create solutions in ways that aren\u2019t always common for governments. How do you hack processes and rules to create what some ministries called magic?\r\n\r\nThis talk will tell the inside hacker tale of the pandemic and show the dilemmas that were overcome. This is a story of hackers in a ministry at the heat of the moment.",

In this talk, we'll try to frame questions, if not answers, grounded in the context of the political changes required to mitigate and survive climate change, global fascism, and hypercapitalism.",
                                "description": "This talk starts from two threads.  First, the common understanding of \"freedom\" derives from the institution of slavery.  Looking at alternate definitions provides the foundation for rethinking the building blocks of society and human interaction.  Second, climate change represents an immediate existential threat to human civilization, but mitigating it is no longer a question of technology \u2014 only of collective will.\r\n\r\nIf we insist on maintaining existing structures of ownership and inequality, we significantly reduce our chance of survival.  However, these questions of freedom, ownership, and equity aren't just political questions, they're directly encoded in the infrastructure we all rely on to survive \u2014 that same infrastructure that we currently need to replace, almost wholesale.\r\n\r\nIn reality, any path to survival will imply a muddle of adaptation, mitigation, replacement, and elimination, both of infrastructural components and of elements of the social contract and its governance systems.  Harm reduction is more important and more probable than ideologically perfect revolutions (or even evolutions).  However, plausible visions of the future are a critical ingredient for the hope we need to continue the work, and will also directly shape that work.\r\n\r\nMost folks who live in ownership societies (almost everyone, now) find the idea of moving away from an ownership model terrifying, because it means giving up those things that give them a sense of security.  Understanding the emotional interiority of life in a post-ownership society can change that, and understanding the dynamics of different freedoms can help us understand how we might get there.\r\n\r\nAs people who build infrastructure, we can play with the social models our infrastructure encodes \u2014 and have been doing so for decades.  Likewise, we can (and have been) rebuilding pieces of the social contracts that shape our personal lives.  This talk aims to leave you with new questions and new directions for that work.",

Although the Idemix credential system has been around for a while it is still relevant today.

In case of IRMA, this focus would be on storing your attributes on your local device and on the information flow when the IRMA app is used.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this talk we want to dig deeper, demonstrate the crypto behind the curtains and give you the means to reason why IRMA is a neat solution.\r\n\r\nNote that the talk is very technical. We will cover the theory of the zero-knowledge proofs, the Camenisch-Lysyankaya signature and the Idemix credential verification, all with references to the Go implementation of the Gabi library. If time allows, we'll also cover IRMA-specific solutions such as the keyshare protocol and revocation.\r\n\r\nWe will cover a lot of ground very quickly but after this talk you will have an excellent starting point for truely understanding this anonymous credential system. Of course we'll provide you with follow-up material and are happy to chat some more after the talk with a beer or two.\r\n\r\nBackground knowledge that will help in understanding this talk:\r\n- general understanding of public key cryptography (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsqqpO9R5Hc, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL7J8hPKEWY )\r\n- some context on IRMA (https://irma.app/docs/overview/)",

                                "description": "In this presentation we discuss hardware attacks in general, their use cases, and real-world examples. We then discuss electromagnetic fault injection in detail. We compare the results of the previous research on microcontrollers and secure elements to more modern high performance system on chip devices. We discuss relevant features of modern Arm systems on chip and answer the two main questions of this research. Are electromagnetic fault injection attacks applicable and efficient when applied to software running at gigahertz speed on a modern multicore system on a chip? And to what extent does the operating frequency change the effectiveness of electromagnetic fault injection attacks?",

Extreme events can impact the reliability of such systems. Decentralized, and more privacy-preserving systems, such as [IRMA](https://irma.app/) can help to build more reliable authentication infrastructures. With IRMA, a user can store signed attributes, such as their full name or address, within the IRMA mobile app. Subsequently, the user can disclose a subset of her attributes to parties during an authentication session. The [Verifiable Credentials (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) standard helps to make such systems interoperable, that is, users can use attributes across different credential systems. With a proof of concept, we show how to make IRMA VC-compliant.",
                                "description": "During extreme events, such as power outages or big floods, centralized systems are especially vulnerable as their availability can be impacted. This could result in that the whole system is unusable. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop decentralized infrastructures, as one is not dependent on centralized components.\r\n\r\nDigital authentication nowadays is mostly done via centralized systems, such as DigiD, the authentication system of governmental services in the Netherlands. Every authentication session goes through a central authority, which makes the system centralized. Additionally, from a privacy-perspective, an issue is that such a system can keep track on which sites users authenticate. To achieve more system reliability and more user privacy, it is desirable to develop authentication systems that are working in a more decentralized manner.\r\n\r\nOne existing solution to this challenge is [IRMA](https://irma.app/). IRMA stands for I Reveal My Attributes and is developed by the Dutch non-profit organization [Privacy By Design](https://privacybydesign.foundation/). A central element of IRMA is a mobile app, which the foundation promotes as a digital passport on your own mobile device. Users can collect signed attributes, a set of attributes is called a credential, from authoritative parties. An attribute is for instance, your Dutch BSN, full name, or email address. IRMA protects the privacy of individuals by letting the individuals decide which attributes they want to disclose to whom, and by implementing advanced cryptography, including zero-knowledge proof techniques. Consequently, the receiving party can validate the authenticity of the disclosed credentials without the need to contact the party that issued the credentials.\r\n\r\n[Verifiable Credentials (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) is a standard developed by the W3C. It provides a data model and a syntax aiming to make credential systems interoperable, for instance, it can enable users to disclose credentials issued by one system to another system.\r\n\r\nCurrently, IRMA can only be used within the IRMA ecosystem, that is, among servers and mobile apps that use the IRMA attributes. However, it would be desirable that people are able to use such advanced technologies and authentic attributes on the entire web across different systems. This avoids that people need different apps to be used, that could contain the same attributes, with different systems. Our research shows that it is possible to make IRMA VC-compliant via a proof of concept. Subsequently, through VCs, IRMA attributes are available for servers and apps outside the IRMA ecosystem. Similarly, other credentials can become universally verifiable.\r\n\r\nAs decentralized systems become increasingly more available, governments and other organizations can utilize reliable and privacy protecting authentication widely. This benefits everyone \u2013 even and especially during extreme events.",

                                "description": "For many years, C has been the dominant language in the embedded world and especially microcontrollers. Almost all embedded systems are written in C. The last few years this has been changing, with new languages being used for this purpose:\r\n\r\n  * [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/embedded) has seen rapid growth in embedded systems with its focus on safety and expressiveness. It is in fact a great replacement for C, as it is just as low level and efficient as C but without all the footguns. However, many people find this language hard to learn.\r\n  * Another language that's sometimes used is Python, in the form of [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/). This is in fact what powers the SHA2017 and MCH2022 badges. While the project is an amazing accomplishment, it still suffers from the fact that the language is interpreted and there are limits to how fast it can be.\r\n  * Some people have also used other languages, such as [Lua](https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/release/), [JavaScript](https://www.espruino.com/), [Oberon](https://www.astrobe.com/), [Forth](https://hackaday.com/2017/01/27/forth-the-hackers-language/), [Ada](https://blog.adacore.com/ada-on-the-microbit), and probably others. I'm not aware of a language that got much further than experimental or very specific uses.\r\n  * Then there is [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/), which is a new compiler for the Go language and primarily targets baremetal embedded systems and WebAssembly. This is what I will talk about.\r\n\r\nTinyGo is a new compiler for the Go programming language. Its goal is to implement the Go language specification, be able to compile most of the Go standard library, but still optimize well enough so that binaries can run on a range of large and small embedded systems. It optimizes much more aggressively than the main Go implementation and the resulting binaries are able to run on systems ranging from the Arduino Uno, to the BBC micro:bit, to the MCH2022 badge with an ESP32 chip. I believe TinyGo offers most of the ease-of-use benefits of interpreted languages while providing most of the performance benefits of languages such as C.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will cover what kinds of problems C can cause, why Go can be a great fit on embedded systems, an explanation of some optimizations that it does that help lower its code size and RAM consumption, and some examples of projects written using TinyGo. Oh, and of course some demos.",

At some point I started to learn programming Python (around the age of 12 or 13) and I have been programming ever since. Around six years ago I learned about the Arduino environment, where my previous interest in electronics was revived with a new power: programmable microcontrollers. I didn't like C much so I started looking into alternatives and found MicroPython. But that wasn't exactly what I was looking for either so I did the naive thing and started the TinyGo project with the goal of making the Go language available for microcontrollers.",

The switch to electric cars represents an opportunity like no other to deliver a new type of car that doesn\u2019t carry the baggage of what has gone before, but what I see in the electric cars available to me just doesn't live up to that dream. The car industry now makes cars that don't rust and don't wear out, so for planned obsolescence they now rely on technological complexity to ensure they reach the scrap heap long before their promise of true sustainability can be realised. This talk will attempt to deconstruct the problem, and look at how it might be remedied.",

Over last few years, several large data loss incidents have their origins with attackers finding exposed credentials from source code repositories and these data losses have cost millions to the organization. In this talk, we will share how to build effective gates & mechanics to reduce your current exposure of credentials and ensure you reach and stay at ZERO exposed credentials from source in your organization. This is not just about shift left security, but also about the strategy and automation that is needed to be able to eliminate exposed credentials. The talk will also focus on \u201clive\u201d credential detection that is something very handful of organizations have tried and have had amazing success. Get ready to listen in to a real story of how few organizations have made in roads to reaching ZERO exposed credentials in source and what learnings can you take back to your organization.",

So was Joost de Cock, he didn't - and doesn't - like how clothing stores base their clothing sizes on an imaginary average person; every person has a different body. That got him to found FreeSewing: the open-source platform that translates custom measurements into well-fitting sewing patterns with code.\r\n\r\nThe platform is working towards becoming the Wikipedia of sewing patterns, with new patterns being released every few months, plus a bunch of guides on how to sew. The platform also provides guides for designers and developers, to transform patterns into code. \r\n\r\nThis system based on code allows not only for custom measurements, but also for tweaking the pattern (e.g. longer sleeves, or a crop top) and recycling parts of one pattern into another - whereas a traditional sewing pattern is based on the measurements of a perfect mannequin, which is then graded up and down for different body types, which is known to have many downsides.\r\n\r\nThis talk will not be held by founder Joost de Cock himself, but by an enthusiastic contributor. He will gladly go more in depth on how the code works, common pitfalls, the motivation behind it and how it helps against the rise of fast fashion - maybe encouraging some to pick up sewing themselves?",
                                "description": "A platform that can make tailored sewing patterns, it sounds great - but how does it work exactly? \r\n\r\nIt definitely is an upgrade from traditional sewing patterns. Making sewing patterns may sound easy: they are pieces of fabric, shaped in a specific way and sewn in a specific way. For example, a t-shirt pattern will have these parts: a front, a back and sleeves. But to figure out the right shape, the average pattern designer will make their design based on the shape of their perfect mannequin, and they grade it up and down for different body types. Adapting the pattern for a different shape can be a tedious task. That's where FreeSewing comes into play: sewing patterns aren't based on the measurements of one fit model, but they're parameters; they vary based on what the user puts into the system.\r\n\r\nAnd the platform doesn't just provide sewing patterns; it also has a lot of guides available, for general sewing, specific sewing patterns and even on how to code a pattern into the system. This makes it not just a platform for sewists, but also for designers and developers.\r\n\r\nSo, enough about how cool I think it is, what exactly do I mean with \"sewing patterns based on code\"? FreeSewing is written in JavaScript and the technique is quite similar to how you would draw a traditional pattern: a bunch of lines for the right measurements, but now a system is drawing those lines for you. A line needs a beginning point and an end point, usually also points that determine the curve; the 'coordinates' of these points are based on the measurements.\r\n\r\nThe sewing patterns aren't just based on custom measurements, but you can also tweak them however you'd like (and within what's possible), e.g. wanting longer sleeves, or a crop top. Another advantage of having code as a base is that you can 'recycle' pattern parts from one sewing pattern into another.\r\n\r\nNot just the sewing patterns are easily accessible online, but also the software needed to create the code: the core library and patterns are available both for NodeJS and the browser. The code and markdown content is hosted by [Github](https://github.com/freesewing/). \r\n\r\nI'm happy that this project wasn't created by a capitalist overlord, but by someone who wanted to change the world for the better. Now there are a lot of sewing patterns available for all types of bodies and I hope it will encourage more people to start sewing their own clothes. Sewing is difficult to learn, not to mention coding, but it's so worth it. Luckily FreeSewing has a vibrant community where there's always someone ready to help with problems. My goal is to share this enthusiasm with others and maybe encourage some to pick up sewing or help out with coding.",

As a security researcher, these were my thoughts when I saw the tablet mounted on the wall of my new apartment.\r\n\r\nIn a short period, I discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the system. A concern for sure, considering the system allows for remote access and has integration with services in my apartment and the building. This talk will cover my path, my process, and coverage of the vulnerabilities I discovered.",

In the early 90s, the idea of browsing the world digitally and visiting any place was groundbreaking. The first solution to this problem is known as \"TerraVision\", which was breathtaking at that time. Today, the idea of exploring your surroundings using digital maps has become pretty normal.\r\n\r\nBut how do these maps work? In this talk, I want to provide an overview of the foundations of digital mapping solutions. Differences between maps which use vector data and rasterized satellite imaginary will be outlined. Furthermore, a new and open-source map renderer called [maplibre-rs](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs) will be presented, which is created using Rust and modern web technologies like WebWorkers and WebAssembly. Lastly, I want to show differences between commercial solutions and free and open-source ones.\r\n\r\nA lot of mobile and web applications depend on customizing and displaying maps. There are not many cross-platform solutions available. Some only work in the web. Some only work on mobile devices. \r\nFurthermore, there are only a few truly free and open-source mapping stacks available.\r\nI want to highlight challenges and differences between different commercial and open-source approaches. By doing this, we will also discover state-of-the-art limits in accuracy and quality of maps.",

It takes a lot of steps until edits from OpenStreetMap contributors are finally rendered in consumer applications. With this task I want to take listeners on a journey from drawing changes in the OpenStreetMap editor all the way until vectors are uploaded to from memory to GPUs.\r\n\r\nLike outlined in the abstract, I want to cover multiple topics:\r\n\r\n* Foundations of digital maps (How to determine which data should be loaded? What are vector and raster tiles?)\r\n* Show the technology stack which allows us to design and develop a cross-platform map renderer (Web, Mobile, Desktop)\r\n* Show the limits of current open-source solutions. I want to highlight why it is difficult to reach the rendering quality of Google Maps for example.\r\n\r\nLastly, I want to provide a software developer perspective. Why is every developer using either Google Maps or Apple Maps today? What does it take to operate a mobile app which is built only on open-source frontend and backend infrastructure?",

Ranging from the automotive hacking papers in the early 2010-ies by US researchers, towards the infamous Miller/Valasek presentations starting 2015, the magic work of KeenLabs and 360 Group, and covering comma.ai, the different Tesla hacks, entry system relay attacks and the recent ADAC study, towards AI-confusion attacks. I will try to analyze the underlying vulnerabilities, how they can be (respectively are already) prevented in modern vehicles, and what the future holds. \r\n\r\nI will also present the implications of the upcoming ISO 21434 & the impact it has on the automotive development lifecycle, as well as the upcoming CCC protocol for unlocking a car with your smartphone.",

Although the legitimacy of these strategies can be debated, they fail to address the root of the problem. Following the pervasive concept of private property and how it has infiltrated the ways in which we think about ourselves, our relationships between each other and the environment, we will arrive at how this concept has solidified itself within the ontological frameworks we use to make sense of waste and electronic waste in particular. We will discuss how, when we get rid of the concept of private property (and subsequently the concept of waste), we can reimagine what abandoned electronics mean to us and how we can best address the incessant pressure from manufacturers to treat them as expendable, throw-away objects. We will discuss how collective dumpster diving, hacking and reverse engineering abandoned electronics might be a possible solution and present free and open source tools that could aid us in the process.",

                                "description": "Our climate is on fire, but we are still reaching for an Ultimate Solution.  We don't move until we get a drop-in replacement to sustain current habits, at no extra cost.  Our cognitive dissonance makes us trust politicians to deliver on promises, and energy vendors to withstand lucrative green washing.  But it is both interesting and profitable to be part of the solution, and not of the problem.\r\n\r\nI have a long-standing fascination with microbial processes.  They are adaptive and resilient while they modestly take on chores that pull things back to nature's standards.  I think many problems that we are facing now can be solved locally and efficiently with clever combinations of technology and microbiology.  Not always complete solutions and not everything is simple, but they certainly add to resilience and taking ownership of problem *and* solution.\r\n\r\nIn a perfect situation, energy is harvested when&where it is abundant and moved to when&where it is needed.  This talk demonstrates ways of doing at least some of that with the help of microbial systems.  We will demonstrate overlap and connections, and conditions under which they may be hacked:\r\n\r\nOutline:\r\n\r\n  * Beer.  Vinegar.  Innoculation.  Permaculture.\r\n  * Gut.  Fiber or Fat.  SCFA.  Immune system.  Epigenetics.\r\n  * Biogas.  Acetate.  Sulphur and ammonia.  Garbage in, garbage out.\r\n  * Microbial fuel cell.  Clay and carbon.  Training.\r\n  * Pee.  Urea.  Energy calculations for a Raspberry Pee.\r\n  * Poo.  Phosphate.  Energy calculations for iPoo mobility.\r\n  * Compost.  Worms.  Energy calculations for heat generation.\r\n  * Climate change & zoonose.  Cramming sick animals.  Antibiotics.  Government ignorance.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n  * Making beer uses yeast to turn sugar to alcohol.  Yeast can flexibly adapt from/to glucose via DNA switching to generate different enzymes.  Let fruit flies in, and they bring along Acetobacter that reduce alcohol to vinegar.  Wild fermentation is more natural, and yields a lambic beer.  Save work by going for stable, naturally mixed processes.\r\n  * Our gut processes whatever we can't.  Two rough kinds of colonies co-exist.  One consumes cholesterol/bile and the other plants/fiber.  They tune our body via SCFA, the immune system and epigenetics.  You can hack by changing your food (and after a few weeks, the microbes are thought to hack you by asking for more; so much for free will?!?)\r\n  * Biogas works like a gut.  It forms/consumes acetate CH\u2083COOH to produce CO\u2082 and methane CH\u2084 with byproducts hydrogen H\u2082, hydrosulphide H\u2082S and ammonia NH\u2083.  Local cycles can process known sludge and produce usable liquid output, but large-scale anonymity destroys that.  Some influences are possible, but the process is basically difficult, smelly and a bit dangerous.\r\n  * Microbes can live in a fuel cell, which then accepts electrons and passes H+ through a membrane.  Urine can be broken down with just clay and carbon -- and a culture.  What are researchers doing?  A variant to produce hydrogen H\u2082.  And the potential of driving microbes by passing in a current.\r\n  * Pee contains urea (NH\u2082)CO(NH\u2082), a hydrogen carrier.  Urea is stable when dried, but otherwise reduces to ammonia NH\u2083.  Soil microbes normally turn ammonia into atmospheric N\u2082 and water.  But we can also use urea in a fuel cell to extract electricity or hydrogen.\r\n  * Poo contains many microbes, some of which are pathogenic.  But it is also our disposal channel for phosphorous (which we mine to grow food) and nitrogen.  Troubled hygiene, but can this be safe?  Is it a good idea?\r\n  * Compost is incredibly straightforward and safe.  The nutrient cycle is so short that nature could have invented it... oh wait, it did.  Spring brings a gradual start, Summer collects energy, Autumn sheds it off and Winter benefits from the captured energy.  Because composting generates heat, and has been used for heating homes, or parts of homes.  Though mostly self-controlled, there are broad requirements for heat retention, moisture, oxygenation and C:N ratio.  Working with these, you can have some degree of control over this process.\r\n  * Microbes mutate if we force them into another environment.  Like a sick animal.  Or 3000 of them.  Antibiotics form a bonus challenge.  Many animal farmers carry resistent microbes.  Zoonoses are on the rise due to climate change, and they are the common source of infectious diseases.  Government practices [best effort management](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/wob-verzoeken/2020/10/28/besluit-wob-verzoek-prognoses-ziektekiemen-uit-dierhouderijen/Besluit+Wob-verzoek+prognoses+ziektekiemen+uit+dierhouderijen.pdf) by chasing for *known* diseases; they are generally clueless about possible future zoonoses and any involved risk to humans.\r\n\r\n[Session image source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cyanobacteria_guerrero_negro.jpg)",

He then worked as a teacher for a full year, and returned to the university for promotional work.\r\n\r\nAfter acquiring a PhD, Rick founded OpenFortress.nl, aimed at security and privacy, mostly in networking systems, and always aiming at strong cryptography with the easiest user experience.  Five years later, Rick also founded GroenGemak.nl, which aims to research/develop technology for sustainable purposes.

During the design phase, a decision was made to maybe make it into a Do-It-Yourself electronics kit. Many design decisions have been influenced by that decision, as creating a unique prototype is a lot different from creating a succesful kit.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will go over some of these design decisions. I think the majority of them worked out very well, as over 1000 kits were sold between 2018 and 2020, before the Gigatron becoming open source. These design decisions were influenced by other kit builders, who had already gone through that process, like the people behind the PiDP-8 and Enigma-E. \r\n\r\nI would like to share some of that knowledge, so you can also stand on the shoulders of the giants before me. And of course to also stimulate the attendees to make their hobby project into a kit.\r\n\r\nNo previous knowledge is needed.

Before you know it, you will be making and receiving calls with your own Asterisk phone system. After that, the possibilities are endless: start sending/receiving faxes, harass telemarketers or create hidden menus.\r\n\r\nTo participate in the workshop part, you will need some sort of VoIP phone. This can be hardware, but a VoIP phone on your PC will be more practical (a so-called 'softphone'). Recommendations for this are MicroSIP on Windows, Telephone on macOS or LinPhone on Linux distros.\r\n\r\nYou will be provided with a trunk account, phone number and Debian VPS with root access.

                                "description": "Recently there's been a lot of research concerning online abuse - for example hate speech and cyberbullying - which takes place in public online spaces, like Twitter or Reddit. But it's much more difficult to research interpersonal abuse that happens in private, such as domestic abuse. It\u2019s difficult to collect data about this kind of abuse, because it tends to happen behind closed doors, and there are still a lot of barriers for victims speaking about their experiences. \r\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t an existing dataset of anonymised abusive text messages between intimate partners or family members. Creating such a dataset could help researchers learn a lot more about the language of abuse, and how abuse takes place. It could help create future educational tools to prevent abuse from taking place, and help to increase identification and prosecution of different types of abuse by the police.\r\n\r\nAs researchers, we want to build an online portal where victim survivors of abuse can upload screenshots of messages that they believe to be abusive, in order to be anonymised and used in research about abuse. However, collecting this data raises a lot of ethical, data protection, and technical issues. Is it possible to secure a dropbox and a dataset like this? Is it ethical? What kinds of attacks would the platform be vulnerable to?\r\n\r\nSo we need your help to make this platform as secure as possible! This workshop will take the form of a short presentation about the research and some ideas for how such a portal could be implemented. The rest of the session will be a brainstorming session to try and source expertise and ideas from workshop participants about how such a platform could be hacked, as well as the ethical issues of this research. The workshop will be split into small groups, each with a set of questions, and participants can choose to join the group with the questions that most interest them.\r\n\r\nQuestions proposed to workshop participants would include:\r\n\r\n- HACK & ATTACK: How would you hack this platform? What attacks is it likely to attract? What are it\u2019s vulnerability\r\n- TOOLS TO DEFEND: What are the options for a secure database backend? What tools and platforms are available to scan for unwanted content? (e.g. to protect researchers from seeing explicit images, for example). What methods are available to protect from spamming? - Are there other fields that use similar techniques? e.g. a secure dropbox for whistleblowers\r\n- DATA PROTECTION & ETHICS: What are the arguments for and against such a dropbox, from a data protection perspective? How could such data be securely anonymised? How can you completely anonymise uploads to such a dropbox? E.g. discard IP and device identifying information from incoming upload packets",

Can we have both? Is moderation censorship? Is Signal social media?",
                                "description": "The debate about how to deal with abusers and fascists on social media has been simmering for a long while, but really blew up after the siege of the US Capitol. It has become clear, finally, that [something needs to be done](https://redecentralize.org/blog/2021/01/18/centralization-is-a-danger-to-democracy.html). What remains unclear is... what?\r\n\r\nThis workshop will probably not offer answers, but will at least try to make sense of that debate. A debate which is tangled and twisted, and complicated by the fact that for some (like journalists) social media is the infrastructure they need to do their work and reach their audience, while for others (like activists) it's the service they use to communicate among themselves.\r\n\r\nCombine this with how strong the incentives are for centralized social media monopolies to not \"police content\" (lest they be accused of censorship), and how their algorithms tend to promote most-clickable (and therefore often  extremist) content, and you find yourself in a discussion where journalists defend Nazis' access to Facebook.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty to unwrap there, so let's sit down and try to do just that together. Things that seem important (of course we will not limit our discussion to only these!) would be: \r\n\r\n## Is social media infrastructure, or service?\r\n\r\nIf it's infrastructure, we want it to be neutral (just like we want our ISPs not to police our bits on the wire). If it's a service, perhaps we want some moderation to happen?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it needs to be both &ndash; [a neutral infrastructure on which opinionated services can be built](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)? This would immediately simplify this conversation, making it clear where moderation belongs, and where it doesn't.\r\n\r\n## Giving platform vs. providing tools\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between giving platform and just providing communication tools. It is hard to argue Facebook not banning a prolific fascist does provide them with a platform. It is as hard to argue that Signal doing same does not.\r\n\r\nThis difference seems to disappear in a lot of discussions; for example, when some propose that mainstream social media should ban fascists, others claim that it doesn't matter since they will still be able to communicate on Gab or Parler.\r\n\r\nHowever, neither Gab nor Parler has the reach of mainstream social media. Effectively, this leaves their users stewing in their own sauce, not able to radicalize anyone new. They can still communicate and organize, but adding new members comes with added friction. So, how important is that friction? How much difference does it make?\r\n\r\n## Public vs. private channels of communication\r\n\r\nA public Twitter profile with 50k followers is clearly a public channel. A Signal group of 10 people is clearly a private channel. Should a 50k-member Signal group considered private or public?\r\n\r\nThis question is relevant in the context of platform vs. tools distinction above. It's another way of asking: what is, really, the difference between a platform and an internal communication tool?\r\n\r\nSignal has already added several \"social\" features (message reactions, and being able to join groups by clicking a link). Is keeping the groups invite-only on an encrypted platform enough for them to not be considered a \"public\" channel? If not, should Signal start moderating groups?..\r\n\r\nWhat about closed Facebook groups &ndash; can these be considered private channels? If so, can they be ignored by Facebook moderators?",

At this workshop we would like to concentrate on the tools people currently and could potentially use to form communities around the work they create and publish. Together with the participants, we would like to sketch alternative forms of community building through publishing in a broader sense. After a short introduction, we will go for online excursions to pursue on various platforms, tools and protocols; in small groups.\r\n\r\nDuring these exchanges in small groups we will collect chat logs, screenshots, notes, thoughts on imaginary systems and drawings related to online community building in, outside and beyond the mainstream platforms. At the end of the workshop we will have an unedited (e-)pamphlet that contains these sketches, as well as found materials from the excursions made on specific platforms, tools and protocols. This (e-)reader/pamphlet would work as a manual or an inspiration for future attempts of self-publishing.",

Materials cost 20\u20ac per kit.\r\n\r\nWe are going to build an electronic kitten using tiny tiny SMD parts. It will purr when you touch it right and hiss when you touch it wrong. It's going to work. You will learn how to make your hands not shake at all ever. You will learn how to activate your builtin precision positioning superpowers.\r\n\r\nFor people afraid of surface mount assembly/rework. You know those tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you how!\r\n\r\nThink you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s? Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe workshop kit costs 20\u20ac. Please SIGN UP ON THE PAPER LIST at the Hardware Hacking Area.

Geopolitical conflicts and accessible offensive security tools make defending against these threats increasingly complex. The anthology I bring for you illustrates the evolution of cyber physical threats through several stories with topics that span from non-fiction espionage and crime thrillers to politically-motivated intrusions and master tinkerers\u2019 ill-fated creations. By focusing on the different players involved and their motivations, I intend not to hype up the scenario, but instead to accurately describe what we observe daily in the cyber physical threat intelligence community.",

What if these spillovers escalate beyond your grasp? How and what do you communicate internally and externally? In this talk I\u2019d like to walk you through a situation which escalated quickly. The talk is intended to inspire people to take preventative measures, keep their heads as cool as possible, and keep a grip on the situation regardless of the size of the challenge.",

As such; I would like to share my thoughts about how a CISO can lead the pentesting process as effectively as possible, as well as what I as a CISO like to see in my pentesting reports.\r\n\r\nI will also highlight why some reports don't get used and why I think we struggle with this as much as we sometimes do.\r\n\r\nI think this information is usefull for pentesters and CISO's alike, because it shows both sides how the other one works and thinks.",

Many organisations are in the process of moving identity management and authentication out of of their application, and offload it to an identity provider. By doing so, application owners hope to avoid the challenges that come with identity management. However, the application will still needs to obtain the user\u2019s identity from the identity provider, which is done using a single sign-on protocol.\r\n \r\nUnfortunately (or fortunately?), single sign-on protocols are difficult to get right. Flaws in the implementation of single sign-on protocols can have serious consequences. In the worst case, such flaws allow hackers to log into the application as an arbitrary user. And this is not just a theoretical risk, but something I encounter in my work as ethical hacker on a regular basis.\r\n \r\nI will start this talk by giving an introduction to some of the protocols that are commonly used to achieve single-sign on.

By analyzing techniques the perfect Blue Team would use, we define OPSEC measures and techniques to remain undetected and accomplish a successful initial foothold.\r\n\r\nHow would a perfect Blue Team detect malicious domains targeting their organization? \r\no\tBLUE: By dissecting patterns of adversaries and resulting OPSEC mistakes, we specify how domain and Certificate Transparency Log monitoring can unveil domains impersonating your organization. \r\no\tRED: We explain measures the Red Team can take to avoid being caught through domain and CTL monitoring by using wildcard SSL certificates and avoiding typosquatting.\r\n\r\nHow would a perfect Blue Team correlate detected malicious domains to related threat infrastructure? \r\no\tBLUE: Once a suspicious domain is identified, we can correlate this to other threat infrastructure using NetLoc intelligence techniques. Through correlation, Blue Teams can leverage OPSEC mistakes to uncover and potentially burn the whole campaign. \r\no\tRED: We explain measures the Red Team can take to avoid the correlation between their threat infrastructure and avoid the detection of one domain leading to the whole threat infra being burned. \r\n\r\nHow would the perfect Blue Team attempt to block undetected phishing campaigns during their launch. \r\no\tBLUE: We analyze how the use of reputational scoring based on IP, Domain and Mail server, can block many phishing campaigns during the launch itself.\r\no\tRED: We explain how Red Teams can age and categorize their domains to pass IP/Domain/Mail based reputation detections. \r\n\r\nWhat if a phishing mail sneaks by the Blue Team and lands in the inbox of one of their employees, has Red Team won? Not yet:\r\no\tBLUE: The perfect Blue Team has hardened employee endpoints to make a successful exploitation after a click almost impossible. We discuss several defensive techniques on how to block successful initial foothold through Macro execution hardening, Applocker, Exploit Guard and endpoint security solutions. \r\no\tRED: Assuming a fully hardened system, we discuss strategies that could bypass all off these hardening measures and have been proven to be successful in past engagements\r\n\r\nWe conclude with a summary of techniques both Blue and Red Teamers can use to perfect their tradecraft.",

This game involves \"capturing\" the crypto miners using an RFID card to collect the fictional crypto currency PolyCoin.  Each player selects one of four fictional global corporations to support, and captures the crypto miners for their chosen company producing PolyCoins for them.  The company with the most PolyCoins wins!\r\n\r\nDelving in to the brief history of the game at EMF Camp 2018 and 2022, and then explaining how it works and the various bits hang together to create the overall game.  Covering PICmicro, ESP8285 (micropython), DFR0299, RC522 RFID, MQTT, Python on Raspberry Pi, and the hidden features of the game waiting to be discovered.\r\n\r\nI'll cover the problems with the original game deployed in EMF 2018 and how they were addressed with the PolyCoin game in 2022.  Then the problems encountered in 2022 at EMF camp (far less issues!).\r\n\r\nThis would ideally be suited to having this presentation followed by a hands-on session to see the parts that make the game.

Shannon introduced the word \u201cbit\u201d. The article laid down the foundations for the field of information theory which in turn opened up the way to digital information processing.\r\n\r\nIn this overview talk, I will present in an accessible way three nuggets from Shannon information theory:\r\n1. Shannon entropy, a mathematical quantification of uncertainty of a probability distribution.\r\n2. Information Compression: Shannon entropy provides a fundamental lower bound on how much information from a source can be compressed so that it can later be recovered.\r\n3. Error correction: when digital information is transmitted over a noisy channel, the methods of error-correction provide ways to protect this information from noise. Yet again, Shannon entropy provides the fundamental quantity of how much information can be transmitted over a noisy channel.\r\n\r\nWhile the content of this talk is of mathematical nature, I will try my best to make it accessible to anybody with (very) basic knowledge of probabilities and programming.",

While I will focus on making the fundamental theoretical aspects accessible to the audience, all of these concepts also have some interesting (and challenging) programming aspects to them that can be explored further after my talk.",

                                "description": "Sandboxing on macOS was introduced 13 years ago, but Apple didn't leave it at that. Starting with the release of macOS Catalina in 2019, even non-sandboxed apps need to deal with sandbox-like restrictions for files: all apps now need to ask permission to access sensitive files, like those in the user's documents or desktop folder. Features such as the camera and geolocation already needed user approval from a permission prompt. This system of user controlled permissions is known as Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC).\r\n\r\nAny new security measure like this will also mean the introduction of new security boundaries, with new classes of vulnerabilities. Many parts of the system have to be re-examined to check for these vulnerabilities. For example, apps can now try to attack other apps in order to \"steal\" the permissions granted by the user to those apps. Apple has taken steps to allow apps to defend themselves against this, such as the hardened runtime. Ultimately, however, it is up to the developer of an app to safeguard its permissions. Many developers are not aware of this new responsibility or do not take it seriously. Developers who are used to the security model of Windows or Linux often do not know that these boundaries even exist. To make matters worse, Apple's documentation and APIs for these features are not as clear and easy to use as they should be.\r\n\r\nThis talk will start with an overview of local security restrictions on the latest version of macOS, Mojave. Then, it will cover some ways these protections might be bypassed in third-party applications. Finally, we will show some vulnerabilities we found in software that allowed escaping the macOS sandbox, stealing TCC permissions and privilege escalation, such as CVE-2021-30688, CVE-2020-10009 and CVE-2020-24428.",

With governments realising the potential of the internet in spreading information as well as misinformation. \r\nTo curb or rather control this, governments around the globe have taken to censoring parts of the internet by directing major ISPs to block access to those websites.\r\nThe ISPs around the globe have used different methods to block the access. Some resulting in DNS filtering to others doing SNI ( Server Name Information ) inspection.\r\nThere have been ways to bypass these restrictions, like DoH ( DNS over HTTPS ) and eSNI ( encrypted SNI ), now ECH ( Encrypted Client Hello ), supported by TLS 1.3.\r\nTo counter these, some authoritarian regimes ( like China ) have blocked eSNI traffic altogether, to be able to sniff the traffic and block the websites accordingly on their \u2018Great Firewall\u2019.\r\nI will be talking about how these different mechanisms of blocking user traffic works, by doing a live demo of packet analysis using wireshark.\r\nLater on in the talk, I will show a comparative study of the different ISPs around the globe and what their approaches are at blocking the internet ( if any ).\r\nAfter understanding how the technologies work, I will show ways to bypass the censorship by some open source tools, DIY solutions and finally some paid/managed alternatives. What are the things that one should look for when choosing one such paid solution.\r\nTowards the end, I will announce the open source repo for the tool used to conduct this project, where people can contribute and use it for their own research purposes.",

There has been some previous research into this, but that has included some limited dataset, back in 2020. From then to now a few things have changed including the way ISPs are blocking websites.\r\n\r\nWith this project I am trying to :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Analyse the global censorship of internet\r\n    1. Globally how different ISPs block the network traffic\r\n    2. Distribute the client globally and ask volunteers to run this atleast once\r\n2. Release the client and server code as open source\r\n3. Publish all the data, country wise on a github repo for everyone to consume\r\n\r\nThe talk would be in two parts :\r\n- First : Where I talk about the technical nitty-gritties as to how censoring in modern times work.\r\n- Second : After understanding how the technologies work, we will try to bypass those by some open source tools, some DIY solutions and finally some paid/managed alternatives, what are the things to look for when choosing one such provider.\r\n\r\nHence, even for folks who aren't much into the technical details of censorship, would have some arsenal of tools to bypass it, by the end of the talk. \r\n\r\n\r\nStarting with the famous question :  \\\r\n\u201cWhat happens when you type a (https) URL in your browser and press enter ?\u201d \\\r\n \\\r\nI will cover all the aspects starting with :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DNS lookup\r\n2. TLS Handshake - ClientHello,TLS negotiation, ServerHello etc\r\n3. Encrypted Data Transfer\r\n\r\nAll of these would be shown a live demo of in wireshark, alongwith decrypting the traffic using certificates.\r\n\r\nExplaining these stages are important because each of these involve ISPs tampering with to censor the internet. Once we know how it\u2019s done, we will figure out how to resolve this privacy issue.

Sends request to alexa top 1M domains\r\n2. Records packet response and to find what kind of filtering is in place ( if any )\r\n3. Sends data to central dashboard server for generating heatmaps and graphs\r\n\r\nThe tool, server app : \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Will consume all the JSON data and validate its findings.\r\n2. Generate heat maps for all the ISPs and different websites that are blocked.\r\n\r\nTalk about solutions to bypassing the censorship :\r\n1. Open source tools & solutions - DoH, changing default DNS etc\r\n2. DIY things - self hosted 1-click VPN, ephemeral on-demand sshtunnel etc\r\n3.

Operationally this move to audio over IP has provided many benefits, such as being able to use the same equipment for audio as they use for video and lighting rather than special sets of gear for each aspect of a production. However with the increased use of commodity IT hardware in this operational technology (OT) environment comes an increase in attack surface from more software, easier access and less segmentation. As with many places where IT components get re-purposed for OT the administration practices and development practices of the vendors haven\u2019t necessarily caught up with the with the best practices of there IT counterparts. There are some hard problems to solve for audio over IP such as multicast encryption and authentication but also much simpler but more cultural things like updating a working system. \r\n\r\nIt is hoped that by presenting this topic to the broader community of hackers that more talented people get interested in the hard bits, and perhaps we can even reach the folks on the operational technology side to see what measures can be taken to improve the security of existing systems.\r\n\r\nOutline (50 minutes including Q&A):\r\n\r\n1.

                                "description": "[drand](https://drand.love/) (pronounced \"dee-rand\") is a distributed randomness beacon daemon written in Golang.\r\nIt has been used by Cloudflare, EPFL, Kudelski Security, UCL and other partners to setup a distributed randomness project that was unveiled in June 2019: the [\"League of Entropy\"](https://blog.cloudflare.com/league-of-entropy). Since then even more members have joined the league.\r\n\r\nServers running drand can be linked with each other to produce collective, publicly verifiable, unbiasable, unpredictable random values at fixed intervals using bilinear pairings and threshold cryptography. Drand nodes can also serve locally-generated private randomness to clients.\r\n\r\nGenerating public randomness is the primary functionality of drand.\r\nPublic randomness is generated collectively by drand nodes and publicly available. The main challenge in generating good randomness is that no party involved in the randomness generation process should be able to predict or bias the final output. Additionally, the final result has to be third-party verifiable to make it actually useful for applications like lotteries, sharding, or even \"nothing up my sleeves\" parameter generation for security protocols.\r\n\r\ndrand relies on the following cryptographic constructions:\r\n  - Pairing-based cryptography and Barreto-Naehrig curves.\r\n  - Pedersen's distributed key generation protocol for the setup.\r\n  - Threshold BLS signatures for the generation of public randomness.\r\n  - ECIES for the encryption of private randomness.\r\n\r\nThese are well known, while still relatively cutting edge cryptographic schemes.\r\n\r\nWhy do we need such randomness?\r\nA lot of reasons actually:\r\n - Lotteries, jury selection, election event, random sampling for audits, ...\r\n - Protocols & cryptography:\r\n\t- Verifiable gossip: randomly choosing peers in a verifiable way in a network to disseminate information\r\n\t- Parameters: Nonces & IV for symmetric encryptions, composite or prime numbers for selecting a field for RSA, or even ECC\r\n\t- Schemes: Diffie Hellman exchange, Schnorr signatures, more generally for zero knowledge proofs,\r\n\t- Protocols: Tor (e.g. path selection), sharding (Omniledger), leader election for consensus\r\n - Statistics:  verifiable random sampling, reducing bias e.g. in controlled trials in medicine, etc.\r\n\r\nNow, drand is a software ran by a set of independent nodes that collectively produce randomness and whose long term goal is to implement Randomness-as-a-Service:\r\n - Fetching randomness should be as simple as fetching time from NTP servers.\r\n - Nodes can serve both private randomness and public randomness:\r\n\t- Unpredictable and bias-resistant\r\n\t- Publicly Verifiable\r\n - Decentralized service using threshold cryptography, with high availablity, reliability and trust.\r\n\r\nThis talk will NOT be about just the cryptography behind drand, but I will cover some of the basics in a simple way in order to tease the people that could be interested, while introducing cool cryptographic constructions to the rest. It will NOT be about how drand is built, but it will really be about the **practical use-cases for drand**, how to use it, its kind of randomness, what it means and why you might want to use it.",

Jan-Willem, from The Open Organization of Lockpickers (Toool), will share his ideas on mechanical security and threat modeling. We will make it fun and use several case studies, starting with defining a lock, threat modeling mechanical puzzles, and use several case studies where the threat was overrated. Simply put, attacks against locks range from the trivial to mastery. I'll share multiple failed attempts of attacks that should be trivial, but were not in practice, and we will analyze them together.",

This is happening on a small and local scale, as well as on a large and global one. Precisely because these data are potentially personal, and its use is becoming commonplace, it is urgent to internalize shared principles for the responsible use of data to achieve greater common value, better data and better products. These are preferably intrinsic principles that guarantee the safety and privacy of people, our social values and human dignity. In this talk we discuss an ethical framework for the use of location data. Together with the crowd we will investigate several dilemma's in which location data play an important role. How far can you go? Which values are more important? These are the kind of questions we will present and discuss.",

How do we respect shared public values and the individual rights when developing applications made possible by location data? With the discussions that have erupted around apps for monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that the answers to these questions are not crystal clear.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the ethical reference is to inspire data users, but also policy makers and decision makers to help them collect, use and apply personal location data responsibly. Location data are all data that show where people are located and how they move, whether or not they can be traced. This data can, for example, be collected via mobile apps.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we discuss the different values that are conflicting in the use of location data. We present several dilemma's and cases and will involve the public actively in discussing these dilemma's. \r\n\r\nYou can find a concept of the ethical framework at https://www.geonovum.nl/themas/geo4covid/ethical-framework\r\nIn our work looking for responsible use of spatial data we are working together with W3C: https://w3c.github.io/sdw/responsible-use/",

I will briefly review the technical details of implementing servers or clients of your own, and how to author content as a user. Discussion will cover limitations, grey-areas, and trade-offs in exchange for speed and simplicity.\r\n\r\nThrough these alternative protocols we'll see the small internet in action.",

At Greenpeace we know our strength and our weaknesses when doing actions in physical spaces. We scale buildings and hang banners, we have blocked the petrol harbour in Rotterdam (multiple times) and we stop oil/gas rigs from operating. All these kinds of actions are part of a struggle for a healthy climate and safe planet to live on and so ideologically motivated. \r\n\r\nThe right to protest is a fundamental European right, a right that is very dear to us and important when chased by the law. At Greenpeace we always look at new ways to do disobedient actions. This is why we started a research on how online actions can contribute to campaigns. The last few months we have been looking into the possibilities of digital civil disobedience actions. We looked at the risks, the actions and the possibilities it will bring. One thing we learned is that everyone we talk to about this topic is super excited.\r\n\r\nDuring MCH2022 we want to talk more about digital civil disobedience and what it would look like. Is a mass action blocking the doorway of a bank similar (legally) as an Ddos attack when done openly and with a clear political and peaceful goal? Is dropping a banner from a building the same as defacing a website? At MCH2022 Greenpeace wants to start the discussion, look at possibilities, and brainstorm about this topic. We are looking for your input and help to bring this research project further. Let's meet and talk more during the camp.\r\n\r\nPlease join us for this session and meet, work, brainstorm and solve the questions we encounter together.",

This workshop will give you the tools to recognise these anti-patterns in yourself and others and furthermore the knowledge on how to change your communication for the better in the future. This will support you in getting your message understood.",
                                "description": "Have you ever been in a situation where your communication went all wrong? When an open conversation turned into an argument that left you wondering \"Why did this happen?\" \r\n\r\nThis happens to all of us. Having an understanding about the five most common roles and anti-patterns of bad communication, can help prevent them from happening. Or help you to get out of them. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding of these roles also helps you to create space for good communication \u2013 I.e., what to do and say, when you discover that your conversation partner acts accordingly to one of the anti-patterns.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will explain these roles and anti-patterns, discovering the signs, the reasons behind them, and what to focus on in order to avoid them. It will focus on spoken communication, not on other aspects like body language, facial expression or context and setting.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is a mixture presentation, group chat and self-reflection.\r\n\r\nAbout me \r\n\r\nI am is intrigued by words and passionate about communication, the way we relate with each other and the connections and cultures we create. \r\n\r\nI work as a transformative coach for individuals and organisations and communication is at the core of every interaction in my life - \"You can not not communicate\".",

You know those tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you how!\r\n\r\nThink you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s? Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe workshop kit costs 20\u20ac. Please SIGN UP ON THE PAPER LIST at the Hardware Hacking Area. PLEASE BE ON TIME!",

                                "description": "Smart lights have become pervasive in many homes, but they are often designed in such a way that makes them completely reliant on the manufacturer's servers and connectivity to the Internet. However, for people who want full control of their own devices, there weren't many affordable and easily usable options. \r\n\r\nOne such option became available near the end of 2018 when a vulnerability was discovered in the firmware of smart devices manufactured by Tuya Smart. Shortly after the discovery of said vulnerability, a project by the name of tuya-convert popped up. It allowed its users to remotely flash Tuya devices with custom firmware by exploiting the - at the time - new vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBy 2020, however, tuya-convert stopped working for an increasing number of new devices. The manufacturer had patched the vulnerability, and unexploitable devices have begun showing up on the market. That's when we decided to look for the next vulnerability for Tuya's smart devices in order to allow remote custom firmware flashing once more.\r\n\r\nWe spent some time hacking on early devices which were based on the ESP8266 platform, and a while later switched to the newer devices based on the custom BK7231 SoC. During the course of our research, we found issues in firmware on both platforms and rediscovered some helpful reversing techniques.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll cover our research journey with its ups and downs on both platforms, as well as the details of a memory corruption vulnerability which we exploited on the BK7231-based devices.",

You can find it all around the field, on prints and stickers, on the website and on the event shirts.\r\n\r\nDo you want to know the nitty gritty details of the optical physics, the generative basis and symmetric math ideas behind it? Some of it is obvious, but we would like to talk about it, and go deeper in on the concepts.",

The goal then was the deployment of 300 low cost Air-Quality sensors in Stuttgart. These devices should be easy to build for everyone. Until now the platform has grown to more than 14.000 sensors in over 70 countries (January 2022).\r\n\r\nThese sensors are measuring environmental data as Air-Quality, temperature, pressure and relative humidity. You can see the live values on the live map at Maps.Sensor.Community. Everything ever measured is available as Open Environmental Data. You can download all historical Open Data.\r\n\r\nTo participate you can join a local group which you can discover on the community layer of the map where live values are displayed. -> https://maps.sensor.community/#2/0.0/0.0\r\n\r\nWe invite you to become part of the community. Build a sensor, generate Open Data, share it in a continuous stream with the network and join forces in local Sensor.Community groups to analyse it. Find like-minded people which care about the environment and the implications on our health. Stay informed and exchange with your neighbours.\r\n\r\nOnce the sensor tube is connected to the network its measured values are available live on the map at Sensor.Community. These values are refreshed every 2 \u00bd minutes and enable all citizens to see how the situation is around them.\r\n\r\nThe available historical Open Data of all ever measured values enable other projects to serve citizens with other specific services and functionality.\r\n\r\nSensor.Community is here to serve citizens on a global layer with environmental Open Data. Our focus is to add further sensor methods, collaborate with institutions as RIVM.nl on data standards and better integrations in their daily work. One great example here is the integration of the Open Data from Sensor.Community into the Data-portal of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands at RIVM.nl",

Are strong communities such as feminism fairly given the space and attention they should in free software/hardware communities? Are we building tools for a technology lobby or aiming a free, open and local communities?\r\n\r\n## Communities and free software\r\nTechnology sovereignty movement must be open to constant self and external constructive criticism, learn from older and wiser communities (queer, feminism, anti-racist, anti-fascist...) and be ready to operate in a helper-like type, rather than a savior-like type. While software and hardware is proven to be extremely relevant nowadays, so are the means behind it. \r\n\r\nThe whole workshop is about discussing the future of free software communities, sharing experience on privacy and digital rights awareness for different context and sharing tools, books, articles, associations and resources to keep the topic fueling outside the event. \r\n\r\n## Contents\r\nThe workshop will help people trying to build similar dialogues in their local environments (what to ask, what to bring out, limitations and needs), as well as having a space for sharing information and creating more diverse ideas. If everything goes right, we could keep connected for further projects in the future. These are some of the contents of the workshop:\r\n\r\n- Books, articles and open source reading resources on privacy and digital rights topics.\r\n- Technology in early education and public schools/universities (mostly focused on presenting alternatives to Google Classroom and similar tools, which is [our main project](https://elbinario.net/2021/07/12/fuera-google-de-las-aulas/) from 2021 on Interferencias). \r\n- Engaging with feminism. Learning from the trans-feminism and [xeno-feminism](https://laboriacuboniks.net/manifesto/) dialogues and manifests to create better tech communities. \r\n- [Crafting a code of conduct](https://eslib.re/conduct), in contents and shape (transparency, git, interviews, caring)\r\n- Brainstorming local needs that can use the help of free software/hardware.\r\n- Use of [fediverse](https://fediverse.party/) for engaging communities.",

A human at their worst mental state, is going to interact with a system in drastically different ways than a human at their best. How can technologists design new systems with these psychological vulnerabilities that many humans have in mind? In this workshop, we\u2019ll be using a systems innovation, design and psychology lens to demonstrate practical frameworks to addressing the how.",
                                "description": "There\u2019s a growing awareness in Western society about the negative impacts that technology has on our lives. Parallel to that, there is a growing acknowledgement that mental health and wellbeing is important. But for any prominent change to happen in a positive direction, these discourses cannot stay evolving in parallel - they need to come together and inform each other. \u2028\u2028Trauma and its impacts on human psychology are an all-pervasive force that impact humans on a micro and macro level. It only makes sense that the same force would replicate itself in technology. From the alarming rate of depression in social media use to addictive and detrimental financial decision-making in cryptocurrency trading, technology has a significant impact on human behaviour, melding in and perpetuating pre-existing vulnerabilities we have. \u2028\u2028But how would we map this complex, slightly abstract idea out in a practical way? What would a trauma-informed system look like? Or may we dare to dream of moving forward from being stuck in cycles of trauma? Using a systems-innovation framework, paired with a value-driven design lens and an understanding of trauma from research and our own journeys in it, we\u2019d like to share with you a multidisciplinary design lens that acknowledges trauma as a significant actor within it. \u2028\u2028The workshop will include our a recollection of own experiences in the climate innovation, humanitarian sector and decentralised technology field. We will invite participants to reflect upon how they interact within systems, mapping out the relationship between complexity and unintended psychological consequences, and how to ultimately re-imagine a different world.",
