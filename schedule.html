<p>⚠️ Warning! This talk may contain hackers. There may be hackers in
the room. There may be hackers surrounding the room. There may be
hackers recording this. There may be hackers listening in. There may be
hackers that exfiltrate data. There may be hackers wearing shirts. There
may be hackers carrying spying devices. OH NO! There are hackers
EVERYWHERE! What can we do now, except having a party?</p>
<p>This talk serves as an introduction to the camp. It tells how the
camp works, what new features are being released, how to participate and
what to be aware of.</p>
<p>During this talk there will be some audio-trickery in the Abacus
stage which can not be relayed to the recording or via the stream. As we
cannot film audience reactions, know that it will be more epic than the
final battle scene of LOTR.</p>
<p>In all seriousness: there are absolutely stunning new additions to
the camp.</p>

<p>What do big tech, synthesizers, the crucifixion and Matthäus Passion
have in common? Find the answer in the tech performance The Silicon
Passion. We’ve all embraced big tech —but is it a warm hug or a
strangulation? Bear witness to a debate of biblical proportions between
tech nerds, technology and its users. In The Silicon Passion SETUP, in
collaboration with de Transmissie (David Schwarz en Derk Stenvers) and
Rodrigo Ferreira, is looking for a way out of the pit that technology
has created for them.</p>
<p>The performers draw inspiration from one of the most important
stories about penance: the crucifixion. They want to find out exactly
who or what should be nailed to the cross, and what the world might look
like after a resurrection.Taking the St Matthew Passion as a starting
point, both for the valuable lessons as well as musical inspiration.
Armed with Bachst’ St Matthew Passion and synthesizers we will look for
a new way of dealing with big tech.</p>
<p>SETUP (Utrecht) is a media lab exploring the day-to-day future of
technology. Using a critical yet humorous perspective, SETUP translates
complex themes into more tangible ideas for everyone. In 2021, SETUP
asked several artists to offer new perspectives on penance and
forgiveness for big tech, using the St Matthew Passion. A composed group
consisting of multidisciplinary theater collective de Transmissie and
musician Rodrigo Ferreira came to a stunning result, with live
performances from Theater Kikker and Pakhuis de Zwijger in April 2021.
The new performance in 2022 is the next step in this research.</p>

<p>This is a submission for a keynote talk at MCH2022. The Internet is
both a familiar, comfortable place as well as a bottomless rabbit hole
you can lose yourself in. The Internet has always been like this from
its inception, the difference now is the scale and consequences are
almost immeasurable - and it tests the limits of human imagination. When
you look into the mirror of the Internet what you see reflected back
depends on what you are looking for. It has become largely a reflection
of yourself.</p>
<p>Some inventions are so good that they change the world. When a new
innovation is useful enough, we no longer want to live without it – and
once a technology is practical enough, it soon becomes compulsory.</p>
<p>Electrical networks are a good example of this. While it is hard to
imagine modern life without electricity, electrical networks are a
fairly recent invention. Nowadays, a power outage brings everything to a
halt. If an outage is extensive, not only homes will be affected – shops
and factories also close. Once these networks are down, society will be
offline. Modern society could only last for a few days in a complete
power outage.</p>
<p>If the Internet were to fail, the impacts would be much less
dramatic. Society would not stop during a network outage. Factories
would continue to operate. Information would flow via TV antennas and FM
radio. Of course, work would be much more difficult without network
connections. Most monetary transactions would also cease. In a nutshell,
internet outages are expensive, but they don't kill people.</p>
<p>I predict that, before long, the information network and electrical
network will be equally important to our society. Before long, much like
a power outage, a network outage will bring life to a halt. In fact,
before long, a network outage will also mean a power outage.</p>
<p>Electrical networks have been highly beneficial, but we have become
highly dependent on them. The same is now happening in relation to
information networks. The electrical network needs the information
network to work, and vice versa. Technological development is changing
our society in a fundamental way. This dependency is happening on our
watch.</p>

<p>Building on the very well attended DNA presentations ("DNA: The Code
Of Life") at SHA2017, this talk will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brief recap what DNA is and how it works
<ul>
<li>It is surprisingly digital!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How reading DNA is within 'pro-sumer' reach now
<ul>
<li>(I might bring a live demo for after the talk)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An overview of DNA editing technologies (offline, and online: on
living organisms)
<ul>
<li>Including the famous CRISPR-CAS, but also newer variants</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How does such editing actually work in a lab?</li>
<li>The surprising lack of a definitive link between most DNA mutations
and any effect</li>
<li>Could you hack your DNA? Will people start doing this?
<ul>
<li>Should we try to stop them?</li>

<p>Most security implementations leak information, mechanical security
is no different. It takes sharp eyes, a soft touch, and a good hearing
to distinguish between information and noise. In this talk we will go in
depth on how locks works, and how we can persuade them to disclose their
secrets, and open them without damage.</p>
<p>The Open Organization of Lockpickers (Toool) is a group of nerds
obsessed with mechanical security. We create, collect, take apart,
discuss, and attempt to defeat locks. While we are known for
lockpicking, there are many other techniques for opening locks without
damage.</p>
<p>This talk will focus on the language of the locks, the side channels
in mechanical security systems. We will start with binding order, the
mechanism to isolate the locking elements, and exploit them one by one.
Then we will discuss a wide variety of other methods of gathering
information and opening locks. Most of these methods are not practical,
but working them out gives us great joy, and we would like to share the
highlights with you.</p>

<p>The sound system in the Abacus stage is promoted by HOLOPLOT as 'a
new era of audio'. The system, called X1, allows for horizontal and
vertical directional audio control, which opens up the door for lots of
new creative possibilities. Everything from defying the conventional
behaviour of sound such as mitigating reflection and reverberation - to
dividing a space into virtual zones each with unique audio content, all
from a single sound system. Imagine the left-hand side of a room
listening to a conference in French and the right-hand side in Japanese.
Each side is unaware of the other.</p>
<p>During this session engineers from HOLOPLOT will collaborate with a

<p>Have you ever forgotten a passphrase or lost a hardware token? Lost
access to enough Bitcoin to buy a pizza or two? Encryption is
fundamental to securing our liberties, but key and password management
remain difficult even for professionals, let alone the general
public.</p>
<p>This talk presents Passcrow, an Open Source project attempting to
address one of crypto's largest usability issues: password and key
recovery in a decentralized environment.</p>
<p>Passcrow is a system for community-assisted secure “password escrow”,
making it possible to recover from forgetting or losing a key, password
or passphrase. Born out of a desire to make strong encryption easier
(and safer!) to use for less technical users, the project is in an early
stage of development - but code has been published and the system is
usable today.</p>
<p>Passcrow is many things: there is an underlying protocol, basic user
experience guidelines, a client library for integration with other
(Python) apps, an HTTP API server, and a command-line tool for making
use of the system by hand. Potential applications include password
managers, secure messengers, general purpose encryption tools (including
OpenPGP and hard drive encryption) and cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will discuss the motivation and rationale for the
project, demonstrate how the system works and talk about some of the
challenges and design decisions we have seen so far.</p>
<p>The purpose of this talk is to solicit feedback and participation
from the community; if you are interested in the subject, please come
find me afterwards (my base at MCH will be The Quarantine Arms village)
and let's have a chat! If you miss the talk, you can read about it at
www.passcrow.org.</p>
<p>Passcrow is a spin-off from Mailpile (www.mailpile.is), the secure
e-mail client. Passcrow is inspired by Mailpile's experience attempting
to make e-mail encryption more usable for less technical users, and will
be used in future versions of the app.</p>

<p>Thanks to DNSSEC and DANE, it is possible to automatically verify
user@domain.name identities by checking with domain.name servers. The
real problem however, is integration with existing protocols, instead of
inventing something completely new and perhaps web-only. The purpose of
our work on Realm Crossover mechanisms has been to design generic
solutions that extend many different application protocols, without
changing their protocol specs.</p>
<p>For clients, being able to control an online identity is not just a
cool matter of adding their domain name at the end. It also means that
they control how long the identity exists, if it is an alias, if it can
be a group account with members that they control. (We made identity and
access control libraries to support all that, along with identities that
are only usable until a timeout, from a certain remote domain, under a
particular communication topic, and so on.)</p>
<p>For servers, being able to authenticate users from any domain is an
answer to many questions that otherwise stagnate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does every HTTP server want us to create an account under its
domain, instead of letting us use our own?</li>
<li>Why do we constantly need to confirm our email address by clicking
links?</li>
<li>Why not authenticate SMTP senders and subject others to the most
stringent spam filtering?</li>
<li>Why not publish a mailing list archive in IMAP, available only to
subscribers and searchable with their own tooling?</li>
<li>Why not use AMQP as an automation-friendly document push protocol
with authenticated senders for form submission, bill processing, blog
publications, document archiving, …</li>
<li>Why not share your MQTT dataflow with external parties, so they
don't need to keep a web page open to be notified about, say, a newly
posted document?</li>
<li>Why not share your PGP keys and contact information in your own LDAP
directory but with access control to decide who may see what?</li>
</ul>
<p>All these questions stagnate on problems like <em>You would need to
have accounts for all users in the World</em>. So that is what we solved
in this project.</p>
<p>This project expands the usefulness of many protocols by changing the
way their implementations handle authentication; instead of local
accounts, they follow a backlink to the client's domain. We designed and
built the extensions needed for the backend, and made a few first
implementations. We are hoping to show the usefulness of adopting these
ideas in your own tooling.</p>
<p>We present a number of generic mechanisms for Realm Crossover:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>SASL tokens can be relayed to a Diameter server under the
domain.name;</li>
<li>Kerberos supports Realm Crossover, and a keying handshake can do
this on-demand;</li>
<li>X.509 certificates and PGP keys can be assured with DANE-akin
structures for clients or by a lookup in an LDAP server for
domain.name.</li>
</ol>
<p>For each, some form of domain-owned identity provider is run to
assert identity when an external service needs it. The level of security
is a matter of the user and their domain.name; an external service
should not have to force down the security level of the client's
domain.</p>
<p>These three Realm Crossover mechanisms cover the majority of
application protocols, the notable exceptions being the oldest ones,
like Telnet, FTP and HTTP. Specifically for HTTP, we have defined an
authentication mechanism that adds SASL; this means that new security
mechanisms can be defined in SASL, where it benefits many protocols; it
also means that authentication shifts from the HTTP application to the
server, where the coding environment is better suited for such
responsibilities.</p>
<p>We end with a demo, showcasing a useful authentication flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client desktop, with FireFox and a HTTP-SASL plugin</li>
<li>Server domain, running Apache with HTTP-SASL module under an
independent domain</li>
<li>Server identity client, using Diameter to relay SASL to the Client
Domain</li>
<li>Client Domain, running an identity provider with SASL over
Diameter</li>
</ul>

<p>In March 2022 the Global NOG Alliance (GNA) started the Keep Ukraine
Connected task force to help network operators in Ukraine during and
after the invasion. These are our experiences. A simple idea turned into
an interesting logistics puzzle with a steep learning curve into customs
rules.</p>
<p>What started as a simple idea ("Our goal is to help network operator
groups, I'm sure there is more that we can do than hosting their
websites and email when there is a war going on) turned into a global
aid campaign. We have shipped a truck full of network equipment to
Ukraine, and that was only a tiny part. Many companies and individuals
from around the world have donated money, hardware and software to help
the Ukrainian network operators. Everything from WiFi access points and
PoE switches to be used in the bomb shelters to full-rack core routers
for rebuilding their infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the end the logistics are the hardest part. Finding warehouses to
temporarily store the donated hardware to getting help shipping
equipment across borders and through complicated customs rules (network
devices are dual-use goods, and convincing customs officers that a truck
full of gear qualifies as humanitarian aid can be a challenge…)</p>

<p>Warning (but don't be afraid): this talk contains an overarching
theory of the workings of Internet governance (with an emphasis on human
rights)!</p>
<p>The rules of the road for the Internet infrastructure are designed in
different governance bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Taskforce
(IETF), the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN),
and in Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).</p>
<p>I will showcase how Internet governance institutions are tied
together through 'the infrastructural norm of interconnection'. This
concept helps explain how Internet governance works and why many social
and legal norms, such as human rights and data protection, get resisted
and subverted in the governance of the Internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>This talk is the outcome of 6 years participation in and research of
Internet governance institutions and processes, and is suitable for both
issue matter experts and people who never heard of Internet governance
before.</p>
<p>The entanglement of the Internet with the daily practices of
governments, companies, institutions, and individuals means that the
processes that shape the Internet also shape society. For this talk, I
studied the norms that shape the Internet’s underlying structure through
its transnational governance. Norms are the ‘widely-accepted and
internalised [sic] principles or codes of conduct that indicate what is
deemed to be permitted, prohibited, or required of agents within a
specific community’ (Erskine and Carr 2016, 87). Internet governance is
the development, coordination, and implementation of policies,
technologies, protocols, and standards. Internet governance produces a
global and interoperable Internet functioning as a general-purpose
communication network in transnational governance bodies. I examine four
cases of norm conflict and evolution in three key Internet governance
institutions: the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF); the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN); and the Réseaux IP
Européens Network (RIPE).</p>
<p>I show how social and legal norms evolve and are introduced,
subverted, and resisted by participants in Internet governance processes
with distinct and dynamic values and interests, in order to develop
policies, technologies, and standards to produce an interconnected
Internet. I leverage notions and insights from science and technology
studies and international relations to illuminate how a sociotechnical
imaginary—the combination of visions, symbols, and futures that exist in
groups and society—architectural principles, and an entrenched norm
function as instruments of metagovernance in the Internet
infrastructure. This way, I demonstrate how a sociotechnical imaginary,
values, and norms facilitate, instruct, and evaluate the norm setting
processes in Internet governance.</p>
<p>This talk is empirically grounded in the analysis of mailing lists;
technical documents; policy documents; interviews and the extensive
observation of governance meetings. I have operationalized this analysis
using the following methods: quantitative descriptive analysis; network
analysis; quantitative and qualitative discourse analysis, as well as in
participant observation, including semi-structured interviews and
ethnographic probes.</p>
<p>The aim of this talk is to show how Internet governance happening in
multistakeholder bodies, what I call private Internet governance, solely
functions to increase interconnection between independent networks. In
this process, the introduction of social and legal norms—such as human
rights principles and data protection regulations that might hamper
increased interconnection—is resisted by significantly represented
stakeholders in the process. Ultimately, I argue that while the
sociotechnical imaginary and architectural principles serve to
legitimize this governance ordering, the entrenched norm, what I call
the infrastructural norm that transcends singular institutions, guides
the distributed private governance regime.</p>
<p>The infrastructural norm of voluntary interconnection plays an
instructing and evaluating role in the process of norm development and
evolution in private Internet governance. The infrastructural norm is
embedded in its institutional configuration, technological materiality,
economical incentives, and supranational interest, and ties the private
Internet governance regime together. In conclusion, I posit that the
private Internet governance regime is designed and optimized for the
narrow and limited role of increasing interconnection. As a result, the
governance regime resists aligning Internet infrastructure with social
or legal norms that might limit or hamper increasing
interconnection.</p>

<p>Utilizing collaborative security to collect data on attacks we were
able to detect Log4J in a quite unusual but effective manner. We'll show
you how CrowdSec enables the entire infosec community to stand together
by detecting attempts to exploit a critical 0day, reporting them
centrally thereby enabling anyone to protect themselves shortly after
the vulnerability was made public. The unusual part is that this is done
using FOSS software and by analyzing logs of real production systems but
in a way that doesn't compromise the anonymity of anyone (except the
attacker, of course) and doing so with a reliable result where poisoning
and false positives are almost impossible. Too good to be true? Come by
and judge for yourself!</p>
<p>The objective with the talk is to inspire the audience to understand
why the world needs to think differently towards the threats of
cyberattacks from criminals and which advantages it has when you’re
really utilizing the power of the crowd.</p>
<p>Basically we’ve been doing it wrong until now by thinking that all
the world’s problems can be solved by throwing money at them. Guess
what: They can’t. Defending against hackers is a full time, complex task
that requires a lot of complex tasks to be carried out in the same order
and same way every time to be effective. That’s difficult to do so in
order to make it more doable we should try working together. CrowdSec is
FOSS software that does exactly this by enabling users to share
information about current attacks by parsing log files and sharing basic
information (anonymously) about the attack (source ip, timestamp, IoC)
with the crowd.</p>
<p>CrowdSec could be perceived as a modern form of Fail2ban, though for
Cloud and container-based infrastructure as well and capable of taking
way more advanced decisions a lot faster. Mainly, it’s using a decoupled
and distributed approach (detect here, remedy there) and an inference
engine that leverages leaky buckets, YAML &amp; Grok patterns to
identify aggressive behaviors. It acquires signals from various data
sources like files, syslogd, journald, AWS Cloudwatch and Kinesis,
Docker logs and Windows Event Log, normalizes them, enriches them to
apply heuristics and triggers a bouncer to deal with the threat, if need
be. Since it’s written in Go, it’s compatible with almost any
environment, fast in execution and ressource conservative.</p>
<p>To make sure signals are generally trustworthy we’ve implemented a
reputation engine. Not only don’t we want any false positives - we also
don’t want data to be poisoned. This is taken care of by a trust-ranking
system where we assign a trust to each agent that will grow over time as
the agent provides reliable signals. In this process both persistence
and consistency is taken into account. In this process both persistence
and consistency is taken into account. When an ip is voted for, it needs
a certain amount of points based on the trust rank of each agent that
has reported the ip. This system makes it expensive to poison collected
data. Not only does it take a long time to reach a trust rank that makes
any real difference - also diversity of AS NNumbers are being taken into
account as well. The outcome of this is a reliable blocklist that’s
constantly redistributed to network members in order to achieve a form
of digital herd immunity. An ip caught aggressing WordPress sites will
quickly be banned by all members who subscribed to the WordPress defense
collection.</p>
<p>While CrowdSec is in charge of the detection, the reaction is
performed by “bouncers” that aim to be deployable at any level of the
applicative / infrastructure stack : via nftables/iptables/pf based on
an IP set via nginx/openresty LUA scripting via a Wordpress plugin via a
general PHP/Python/JS bouncer that works with all applications written
in those languages on Cloudflare or Fastly via our bouncer that
integrates with the provider’s API on AWS WAF via our bouncer that
integrates with AWS’ API. .. or in many other ways. Over time the
possibilities will increase as the application design basically supports
anything.</p>
<p>Bouncers can enforce several types of remediations, like blocking,
sending a captcha, notifying, lowering rights, speed, sending a 2FA
request, etc.</p>
<p>This approach, combined with a declarative configuration and a
stateless behavior, makes it an efficient tool to enhance the security
of modern stacks (containers, k8s, serverless and more generally
automatically deployed infrastructures).</p>
<p>We are committed to building a strong community, with all that it
implies : a public hub to find, share and amend parsers, scenarios, and
blockers permissive open-source license (MIT) to stay business-friendly
and overall a strong commitment to transparency and community-first
mentality, by tooling and behavior</p>
<p>In my talk I will dig into the technical nitty-gritty part of
CrowdSec, the architecture and concepts and focus specifically on how we
managed to collect data from live Log4J exploitation attempts using the
crowd and how efficient this strategy turned out to be. CrowdSec is
still collecting data and tracking the result on
https://crowdsec.net/log4j-tracker/</p>
<p>The bigger the CrowdSec community becomes, the better protection
against cyber criminals. So I really want to inspire the audience to
engage in CrowdSec either by installing and using the software, to
contribute documentation or code - or all of them. For the good of
everybody!</p>
<p>Currently CrowdSec is collecting data from more than 45.000 agents in
158 countries. Each day more than 3M signals are collected. Over the
last more than a year over 2.4M malevolent ips have been detected and
verified.</p>

<p>A multi-disciplinary lecture and follow up discussion about
sustainability from the hacker perspective. It will combine the state of
the art scientific knowledge and evidence with observations on the
cultural dynamics of the hacker community. It is the continuation of the
series started at OHM 2013, SH2017, Balccon 2019 and Bornhack 2019</p>
<p>Climate change, habitat and biodiversity loss, environmental
pollution and other consequences of the current globalized society are
here to stay and will get worse in the near future. In this talk, we
will explore the known, expected and possible technical, environmental,
social, economic and political changes that we will be facing in the
next decades. This talk will approach the problem from the hacker /
maker perspective. What can and will the impacts be on technology,
privacy, communication, openness, communities and most important of all,
Aliexpress shipments? What can we, as the hacker community, do to
prepare ourselves and the communities around us to be robust and
resilient to those changes? What can we do to reverse the course of
these changes? Do not expect a prepper talk (okay, just a tiny bit), but
rather a discussion based on empirical observations and scientific
insights from a wide variety of academic disciplines. After the lecture
a informal discussion session will be organized.</p>

of boards in a production panel, how to automatically generate
footprints, how to make your PCBs fit the real world, how to not repeat
your effort when making lots of the same circuit, and how to not make
terrible mistakes and lose your work. It will be a wild tour, but you'll
have much more fun with your PCB design work afterwards.</p>

<p>A workshop format interactive lecture to tackle subjects of mental
health and h/activism. A conversation about on/offline identity,
isolation, burnout, depression, and social anxieties while trying to
connect to those around us to fulfill the desire of "belonging".</p>
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>My name is Sonia and I am writing with a proposal for a “lecture”
regarding mental health in activism called “CyberWell”.</p>
<p>A little about me: allegedly was at some corners of irc, did “mail to
jail” project which focused on sending postcards, mail, and books to
imprisoned hacktivists. Did work with refugee women as well as
work-related to women's rights on/offline and Laury Love case Naomi
Colvin.</p>
<p>Currently, I work as a psychotherapist. My work is focused on social
media's influence on the “creation of opinion” related to various topics
such as self-worth, politics, activism, and isolation (to name a few).
The struggle to keep afloat while suffering burnout and identity crisis.
How we perceive interactions inside our algorithmically generated
bubbles and struggle to find the right tool to bypass those on the
right-wing “Trump” train while seeking authenticity.</p>
<p>After many years of alleged activism, I myself went through a massive
2-year depression, the road out of which was quite a turmoil. I have
seen similar situations happen to my dearest friends many of whom left
IT altogether or disassociated completely with their online personas and
communities. Some we just sadly lost along the way… Perhaps you reading
this, can relate.</p>
<p>I feel that this area of Hacktivism is not spoken about often and
wish to share my story, observations, and some tools for those who might
relate to the subject matter. It could be a lecture or a workshop
depending on the availability of space and time that could be
allocated.</p>
<p>It would be grand if it could be a “lecture” the second part of which
could be a discussion, which is a format I did at CCC on a similar
subject matter but more oriented toward “politics”.</p>
<p>I appreciate your time and effort to create this event and keep us
all connected.</p>
<p>With gratitude, Sonia</p>

<p>Help protect deep brain implants from malicious attacks! Following a
case in our own hospital of a patient with a malfunctioning Deep Brain
Stimulator (DBS), we want to improve our understanding of these
technologies and their susceptibility to malicious hacks. This workshop
will describe the medical case of a patient with a failing DBS, we will
present the DBS system and we will ask you to hack into it! Help us
improve patient neurosecruity by suggesting possible exploits and
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The security of telemetric medical devices is critical to good
patient care [3]. Recent research has described security breaches of
implanted medical devices in the context of diabetes (insulin pumps) and
cardiology (cardiac defibrillators), however this has not been described
in the field of neurology [1-2]. In our workshop we discuss the security
vulnerabilities of ‘Deep Brain Stimulator’ (DBS) devices that are
currently used in healthcare practice for a range of medical
conditions.</p>
<p>Our work revolves around a recent clinical case that we encountered
in our hospital. A patient presented to our Emergency Department with
acute neurological symptoms, which were found to be related to his
malfunctioning Deep Brain Stimulator (DBS). As doctors, this was our
first encounter with such a case and it posed difficult medical and
technological challenges. A number of similar cases, in which patients
with malfunctioning DBS devices have presented with abnormal medical
symptoms, have been reported in the wider literature. Increasingly,
these devices are being monitored remotely by specialists centers and
the telemetric nature of these devices leaves them open to malicious
hacks.</p>
<p>More than 100,000 patients worldwide have received Deep Brain
Stimulation (DBS) for neurological conditions. The adoption of
‘neurotechnology’ or ‘brain-computer interfaces’ has increased across
the medical domain for neurological conditions (e.g. Parkinsons), but
also for ‘emerging indications’ including OCD, Depression and Bipolar
disorder. Additionally, beyond the healthcare space, ‘brain chips’ are
receiving increasing attention for their promise to enhance cognition,
augment reality and manage emotions.</p>
<p>Hacking brain stimulators (‘brain jacking’) has so far only been
reported in theory [1-3]. Targeted attacks of telemetric DBS devices to
affect voltage/current and frequency settings could induce impairment of
motor function, alteration of impulse control, induction of pain and
manipulation of emotions [1-3]. The ability of hackers to exert
malicious control over brain implants has dangerous and potentially life
threatening consequences. For our patients and the wider community, we
want to understand these threats and develop protective measures to
secure the neuro-integrity of our patients.</p>
<p>Recognising and responding to hacks of deep brain devices requires an
interdisciplinary response. We need data scientists and hackers who
understand the vulnerabilities of telemetric systems and potential
routes of tech-induced harm. We need medical physicians and
neuroanatomists to understand the clinical syndromes that may arise from
the intersection of human physiology and digital manipulation. The
workshop will start with a presentation describing the medical case of
DBS failure. Following this, we invite participants to brainstorm ideas
for how a DBS system could be hacked and to consider the ethical issues
of this research. We will divide the audience into small groups and ask
them to consider the following questions:</p>
<p>Questions for workshop participants would include (i)
Vulnerabilities: How would you hack a telemetric DBS device? What
attacks is it likely to encounter? What are its vulnerabilities? (ii)
Defense: What options could improve the security of these devices? (iii)
Ethics: What are the arguments for and against these devices being used
in healthcare?</p>
<p>Following group discussions we will reconvene and share our thoughts
and recommendations. We invite people from all disciplinary backgrounds
to attend and share their thoughts on potential vulnerabilities and
solutions for these systems.</p>

<p>In this workshop, we will learn how to assemble tiny parts on circuit
boards by building an electronic touch-activated purring kitten. Anyone
can do it. Yes, even you who never touched anything electronic before.
Takes 120mins, 20€/kit, avoid caffeine immediately before. Max 10
participants per session, sign up on PAPER at the Hardware Hacking
Area.</p>
<p>Takes about two hours. Basic workshop. No prior knowledge needed.
Materials cost 20€ per kit.</p>
<p>We are going to build an electronic kitten using tiny tiny SMD parts.
It will purr when you touch it right and hiss when you touch it wrong.
It's going to work. You will learn how to make your hands not shake at
all ever. You will learn how to activate your builtin precision
positioning superpowers.</p>
<p>For people afraid of surface mount assembly/rework. You know those
tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible
and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you
how!</p>
<p>Think you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s?
Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is
minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to
THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no
longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the
workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The workshop kit costs 20€. Please SIGN UP ON THE PAPER LIST at the
Hardware Hacking Area. PLEASE BE ON TIME!</p>

<p>People have been modeling different parts of Earth's systems for
decades, on different scales and with different goals from short term
weather forecasting through actuarial risk prediction to long term
climate models. In this talk I'll explore some of the typical models,
methods, data formats, infrastructure layouts and design assumptions
that go into such models, and discuss some low hanging fruit available
to improve them.</p>
<p>Earth is a pretty complicated system, consisting of numerous
sub-systems operating at different time and energy scales. All the
systems are strongly coupled. These include the atmosphere, oceans,
freshwater, cryosphere and biosphere, all of which can be further
subdivided by various schemes.</p>
<p>The problems facing people trying to model these systems are
numerous: there's a lot of data, all of it is bad, most of the code is
written in Fortran, and all of it is horribly slow.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, modeling Earth is computationally intractable
without some simplifying assumptions. For instance, if your global grid
for weather prediction has "pixels" that represent more than 16km², the
physical parameterization can't "see" convection, so you miss most
storms. And yet somehow people manage.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll start with a brief introduction to how some Earth
systems work, describe some parameterizations, and then look at
different free software/open source models operating under different
domains, assumptions, and scales. Finally, we'll do a quick review of
some of the many places where there is room for improvement.</p>

<p>Many 5G networks are built in fundamentally new ways, opening new
hacking avenues. Mobile networks have so far been monolithic systems
from big vendors. Networks are rapidly changing to an "open" model that
mixes software from specialized vendors, hosted in cloud
environments.</p>
<p>The talk dives into the hacking potential of the technologies and new
interfaces needed for these open networks. We illustrate the security
challenges with vulnerabilities we found in real-world networks.</p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Mobile networks are undergoing a paradigm shift from single-vendor
monoliths to open cloud environments. Telco software now comes from
different vendors and is installed on commodity hardware.</p>
<p>OpenRAN is introduced in many (not all) 5G network globally.
Operators hope that OpenRAN will be more flexible and cheaper. But what
about security?</p>
<p>To make building blocks interoperable, OpenRAN comes with new
interfaces, with often unclear security properties. OpenRAN also adds
complex IT technologies, which come with their own hacking issues. Many
components are run on Linux in Docker containers on top of Kubernetes,
adding multiple layers of possible hacking interference.</p>
<p>Mobile networks also become easier to test, including for pentesters
with experience in web apps and cloud environments. This talk explores
how we can best use this new accessibility.</p>
<h1 id="what-we-discuss">What we discuss</h1>
<p><em>1. Technology overview.</em> Which technologies and interfaces
are used in OpenRAN</p>
<p><em>2. Baseline security.</em> Which security measures are part of
OpenRAN, and which gaps are left open</p>
<p><em>3. Pentest/hacking advice.</em> How do you test whether a network
uses necessary security measures</p>
<p><em>4. Tales of caution.</em> Vulnerabilities we found in real-world

<p>From complaining out loud about a televised government app-a-thon to
being hired by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport as lead
developer RoHS running a team of devs to work on all the covid backend
infrastructure exception routes and making sure no person is left in
digital limbo in just under an hour.</p>
<p>When late 2019 the first signs from China of the novel Corona virus
came I was intrigued, During the first "lock down" in the Netherlands
our Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport created an app-a-thon . . and
much hilarity ensued.</p>
<p>As all geeks had seen . . nice ideas people . . but Apple and Google
already have a standard agreed. And a lot of us "Dutch Hackers" where
pretty vocal about it as usual.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at "the ministry" a civil servant started hiring people
from the Dutch hacker scene.</p>
<p>Late December 2020 it came to their attention that there was some
missing or ancient infrastructure in place for vaccine registration, not
at all ready for the then upcoming vaccination landrush.</p>
<p>14th of December I get a call . . can you clean your calendar for the
year?</p>
<p>Sure . . just over two weeks, one of them I had planned as holiday
anyway to watch CCCongres talks. .</p>
<p>Little did I know they meant clear agenda for 2021 .. and 2022 . .
not 2020.</p>
<p>This story takes you from getting very privacy and security aware
infrastructure for registering the first ever Covid vaccination in the
Netherlands built and tested in 3 weeks to the current state of the DCC
infra up close and personal.</p>

<p>SLAPP suits (strategic lawsuits against public participation) are
nuisance lawsuits designed to get journalists, activists, historians,
whistleblowers and others to keep quiet. This kind of lawfare isn't new,
but there is an increasing focus on the issue in Europe, with new
legislation coming. Here's where you find out more.</p>
<p>You receive a threatening letter from a major law firm, probably
based in London, trying to stop your reporting, or your activism,
threatening you as an individual as well as the organisation you are
affiliated with - congratulations, you've just been SLAPPed.</p>
<p>Strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) are on the
increase worldwide, and Europe is beginning to take notice. Lawyers'
associations in Italy and Croatia report hundreds of nuisance suits
being laid against journalists. In Hungary, Poland and Slovenia, the
state and its allies are SLAPPing opponents - journalists,
anticorruption activists, LGBTI+ rights advocates - with impunity.</p>
<p>Litigation has been turned against the activist community, oligarchs
try to silence debate and Eastern Europe has become the new home of
SLAPP-based oppression, as politics slide into autocracy and leaders
stamp down on dissent.</p>
<p>Blueprint is part of an 11-country coalition working on the ground to
train lawyers to help the victims of SLAPPs strike back. We're currently
developing a curriculum from scratch, drawing on European human rights
principles and local knowledge.</p>
<p>If you want to understand the European situation better, or if you
have experience of SLAPPS and can help us understand what kinds of legal
training and other defences are useful to civil society, we'd love for
you to join this conversation.</p>

<p>This session will go over my journey to hack the Quincy drawing
robot. This is a cheap 3-axis drawing robot, that uses a proprietary
"closed" system. I wanted to hack this robot to draw Pokémon's for my
son. I will explain how I deciphered the file formats, figured out how
the robot could be controlled (which needed some very very difficult
math!) and the software I made to create your own drawings.</p>
<p>BONUS: At the end of the session you can WIN one of these Quincy
Robots!!!</p>
<p>This session will explain step by step the process I took to decode
the proprietary file formats, using some simple python coding. This will
give you an insight in general how you can try to decode file formats
that are not documented.</p>
<p>Besides understanding the files, the math behind controlling this
robot turned out to be very complicated. I will explain the difficulty
and if you are a Math Nerd you can see if you could solve this difficult
challenge.</p>
<p>Finally I will show the software I made to create your own drawing
files.</p>

<p>Last April we won Pwn2Own Miami by demonstrating five zero-day
attacks against software that is commonly used in the ICS world. ICS, or
Industrial Control Systems, are systems that are involved with running
an industrial process, for example in a factory or power plant. Our
targets range from SCADA to HMI systems. During this talk we would like
to share details about the competition and the vulnerabilities we
found.</p>
<p>ICS is an interesting field for security research. As a successful
attack could have devastating results. Luckily the number of successful
attacks that truly targeted ICS environments are scarce. At the same
time this industry faces some difficult challenges, such as high
availability requirements, old technology and a low security
maturity.</p>
<p>Pwn2Own Miami is an annual edition of the Pwn2Own competition, that
focuses solely on ICS applications. Targets range from OPC UA
implementations (on of the main communication protocol in ICS), to data
gateways and SCADA systems. They challenge competitors to find zero-days
attacks against any of the targets. Participants need to demonstrate
their zero-days by compromising a target machine running the latest
version of the application.</p>
<p>Last year we participated in the Pwn2Own Austin edition, which
focused on Enterprise applications, with a zero-day chain against the
Zoom client. This year we decided to participate in the ICS edition. It
was a close race, but ultimately we beat the competing teams and won
this year's edition. We demonstrated 3 RCE's, one DoS and an interesting
certificate verification bypass, which in total was good for 90 points
and $90,000.</p>

<p>The Anker 3800 is a mechanical lock that has both traditional pins as
well as magnetic sliders. Can it be opened without the key? This talk
discusses how the lock works in a master keyed system and how it can
possibly be defeated. It will cover decoding, picking and key
duplication.</p>
<p>The Anker 3800 is a mechanical lock that has both traditional pins as
well as magnetic sliders. It was designed by Japanese company MIWA and
is sold in the Netherlands under the Anker brand. It is a high security
lock that is often used in large master keyed systems.</p>
<p>I wondered: can it be opened without the key? I will present my
adventures with the lock, having opened it up to see how it works, and
several things I have tried to copy the key, pick the lock, decode the
lock and find out what the master key looks like. The talk will include
successes and failures and I will discuss designing 3D models, C&amp;C
work, electronics, Arduino programming, PCB design, and more.</p>
<p>The talk is aimed at people with an interest in lockpicking. No prior
knowledge is necessary.</p>

<p>We will give you a short overview over the current electric vehicle
charging technology and why it sucks. Let's try to fix it with the open
source software stack EVerest! We will explain the technology and
architecture behind it and will invite you to join our efforts forward
to a green sustainable transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Building a standard for EV charging infrastructure failed so far for
multiple reasons: "Innovations" are implemented on a timescale of years
to decades, and the standard is typically “designed by committee”. Every
new player in the game has to reimplement the standard and it's done
typically “very lean”, which is furthermore delaying and bugging the
situation. Our solution is to establish a open-source based SW stack for
charging systems, which all companies, manufacturers and private persons
can use and make it the common de-facto standard. By opening the
software for all, anyone can help improve it. We have already made some
progress on our SW stack called EVerest and we would like to welcome you
all in helping to transform the EV charging world. EVerest is part of
the Linux Foundation Energy, a community lead by the green energy
transition.</p>

<p>This is a rant about how moving ecosystems are not a good reason for
centralizing a crucial service, how stickers are no substitute for a
desktop client that does not crash, and how effectively shutting out
less popular OS platforms is just not cool.</p>
<p>In his seminal work <a
href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">"The ecosystem
is moving"</a>, Moxie Marlinspike laid out clearly the reasons why it's
impossible to do what <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)">Matrix</a>, or <a
href="https://fediverse.party/">the Fediverse</a>, or for that matter
the Web, have done: create a dynamic, quickly-evolving ecosystem without
centralizing it.</p>
<p>For years, as a person responsible for information security of
at-risk reporters and their sources, I have been advocating Signal as a
secure Internet messaging service. And with good reasons.</p>
<p>Criticizing a security-sensitive tool like Signal is tricky, as it
might be misconstrued as a call to abandon it, and move to alternatives
that might be in fact worse. But here, at a hacker conference and with
little risk of causing confusion and diverting users towards less secure
platforms, can we please have an honest conversation about Signal's
problems? And how 5 years after that blogpost, moxie's centralization
has not solved them?..</p>
<p>There are good reasons to exert a level of control over what connects
to a communication network. But effectively shutting out a community of
developers that would love to implement Signal clients <a

(many of which happen to attract the kind of infosec-aware crowd that
used to be the core pushers of Signal) is not a good outcome.</p>
<p>Opening up more on the client side and providing some form of
independent client development program (starting with a stable API)
would already help a ton. Even if it's just the desktop client that gets
re-written in something that is not in essence a packaged browser <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22239791">trailing it's
upstream on security patches</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to talk federation. Does it make moving fast and
breaking things more difficult? Yes, yes it does, and that can be a good
thing. It also makes the resulting federated service more resilient (one

And, it lets others innovate without being locked out.</p>

<p>E-signatures in your country are insecure. They have been hacked 10
years ago. Everyone knew that but no one wanted to talk about it since
there is no easy fix.</p>
<p>We decided to create a PoC and poke the government with it.</p>
<p>This is a story on what happened.</p>
<p>⭐ PoCs included ⭐</p>
<p>Electronically signed documents were a great relief to organizing our
daily life during the pandemic. They have actually been helping us for
many years (depending on the country).</p>
<p>It's been known for some time that <strong>dynamic content +
e-signatures = trouble</strong>, but we were surprised that no one has
really done anything about it. In 2021 we got tired of explaining the
vulnerability each partner that sends in a vulnerable asice for signing,
so we created multiple practical PoC that allow you to modify content of
e-signed documents post-signing.</p>
<p>Some of these PoC work against many countries. And there is PoC for
every single country.</p>

<p>Medical devices come in all shapes and sizes, and a great deal of
them contain – or consist of – software. If they are faulty, they can
kill. We’ll talk about different types and classes of medical devices,
the regulations that try to ensure their safety and what all of this
means for medical software projects.</p>
<p>So you have a great idea for a medical product with software that
will make the world a better place? It helps people to regain or improve
their health, cope with a permanent condition or analyze their vital
stats? That’s fantastic! What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>History has shown that faults in medical devices can have disastrous
consequences. Those products may cause severe injury, permanent damage,
even death. In order to make sure that your product does not harm its
users there is a bunch of regulations that you have to comply with. How
does this affect your work?</p>
<p>First we’ll take a look at where to find software in or around
medical devices from embedded code to stand-alone sofware with AI. Then
I’ll provide a few infamous examples of what went wrong (including a
great talk about faulty software in pacemakers from CCC Camp 2019 – you
know, that last great event before THE VIRUS).</p>
<p>Then we’ll talk about the regulatory part, especially at the EU
Medical Device Regulation and what it means for planning, implementing
and maintaining software for medical products (my favourite topic:
traceability. ;-) ). It’s also of interest for non-EU participants
because many of the regulations are ISO-harmonized.</p>

<p>Attacks on cyber physical systems are perceived as necessarily
complex and requiring significant time and resources. However, in the
last couple years we have also observed the inverse: simple attacks
where actors with varying levels of skill and few resources gain access
to software and interfaces that control physical processes. These
compromises appear to be driven by ideological, egotistical, or
financial objectives, taking advantage of an ample supply of
internet-connected cyber physical systems. This is sometimes concerning,
for example when it is affects panels for controlling processes in a
water facilities or manufacturing processes. Sometimes, though, it is
absurd, such as when the critical systems actors claim to compromise are
in fact toys or domestic appliances. In this talk, we will share a
series of stories of success and failure involving low sophistication
compromises on cyber physical systems. We will describe the different
types of cases we have observed, what the actors did, and how you can
reproduce them for good. At last, we will discuss to what extent these
crimes of opportunity represent a risk to cyber physical systems and
what we can do about it.</p>
<p>In november 2021, I presented a version of this talk at a local
non-profit event in Bergamo, Italy. For this event - NoHat - I focused
on sharing the stories of low sophistication compromises we observed
involving software used to control physical processes. However, for MCH
I did some modifications in the title and the presentation itself to
share not only the cases, but also how to reproduce them for good.</p>
<p>The purpose of this talk is to share with the audience how actors
without necessarily a lot of skills or resources are using very simple
tools to hack cyber physical systems. I will do some experiments to show
very quick results the audience can get reproducing these techniques so
that they learn how to find these internet-connected cyber physical
assets and notify the owners.</p>
<p>The outline of the initial presentation was:</p>
<p>• Introduction o Story: Hacked kitchen was supposed to be a gas
system • Define low sophistication cyber physical compromises •
(De)evolution of cyber physical threats o From state-sponsored to
financial, and now opportunistic • Describe low sophistication
compromises of cyber physical systems o Distribution and claims of
exposed systems o Seeming actor motivations o Common actor techniques o
Types of evidence (or lack of) • Low Sophistication Threat Actors Access
HMIs and Manipulate Control Processes o Oldsmar, Florida modified HMI on
water facility o Israel’s advisory on compromises to water facility
systems o Solar energy and dam surveillance system o Hotel BAS • Amateur
Actors Show Limited OT Expertise o “Train control system” was in fact a
human resources tool o Second “train control system” controls toy trains
o Website leaks claiming access to SCADA systems • Hacktivist and
Researcher Tutorials o Two hacktivist groups share tutorials for finding
and compromising cyber physical systems o Researchers have done too –
including a couple examples, such as a recent script to identify tank
gauges • Does this activity pose an actual risk to cyber physical
systems? o Each incident provides threat actors with opportunities to
learn more about OT, such as the underlying technology, physical
processes, and operations. o Even low-sophistication intrusions into OT
environments carry the risk of disruption to physical processes, mainly
in the case of industries or organizations with less mature security
practices. o The publicity of these incidents normalizes cyber
operations against OT and may encourage other threat actors to
increasingly target or impact these systems. • On the bright side… o
There are safety methods in place that stop immediate computer
instructions from modifying actual physical processes  Engineering and
human processes  Missing security on the software side</p>

<p>What are the risks and problems of face search engines like Clearview
AI and PimEyes? Since institutional protection against these systems is
failing us, how can we protect ourselves against this? Three people
involved in the fight against biometric mass surveillance share their
experiences and reflections. Come to this talk to exchange experiences,
learn what tools there are for your protection, how to use them and how
you can help stop the creep of mass surveillance technologies.</p>
<p>Face search engines like <a
href="https://reclaimyourface.eu/how-to-reclaim-your-face-from-clearview-ai/">Clearview
AI</a> and <a
href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/04/tech/pimeyes-facial-recognition/index.html">Pimeyes</a>
have all our faces and process our biometric data. They didn't ask us if
we like their <em>service</em> and if they may use our data. Users of
these search engines can now identify us anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>Since biometric data enjoy special protection under GDPR, we filed
complaints in multiple European states. We report how data protection
authorities did nothing for a long time and tell of the first successes.
However, it became clear that GDPR does not protect against biometric
surveillance.</p>
<p>That's why we have joined forces to form the <strong><a
href="https://reclaimyourface.eu/">Reclaim Your Face</a></strong>
campaign. Together, we call on the European Commission to strictly
regulate the use of biometric technilogies in order to avoid undue
interference with fundamental rights. In particular, we ask the
Commission to prohibit, in law and in practice, indiscriminate or
arbitrarily-targeted uses of biometrics which can lead to unlawful mass
surveillance.</p>
<p>The two face search engines are not the only examples of everyday
biometric surveillance. However, it is difficult to track where else we
are being monitored: There is a lack of transparency and oversight.
Public authorities and private companies rarely report on their own what
they have been up to. We share how we've used FOIA requests, among other
things, to create a little more publicity.</p>

<p>Stalking is unwanted and/or repeated surveillance by an individual or
group toward another person. But what is the impact of tech companies
making it easier to do this with the development of technology? In the
news, we hear about the increase in stalkerware found on devices or
scary government spyware. But it’s not just that, there are so many more
common tools used by stalkers.</p>
<p>From September 2020 to May 2021, the number of devices infected with
stalkerware increased by 63 percent, according to a study by Norton
Labs. But stalkerware is not what I encounter most when I get contacted
by stalking victims. Almost anyone can become a victim of stalking;
stalkers do not just target celebrities. Sometimes they are ex-partners
known to the victim, other times they may be a casual acquaintance, or
just a simple stranger. With stalkerware, the actor needs access to the
device or needs to persuade the victim to install something. In cases
where the stalker is a (ex-)partner, that might be doable. But in other
cases, it is easier to gain access to the accounts of the victim, gather
information about the victim from social media, or use tracking devices
(looking at you Apple and Tile) to follow the victim. Tech companies
develop new apps and gadgets seemingly without thinking about other ways
these can be used. And they end up making it easier to stalk someone.
But what can we do about this problem? Should we lower efforts hunting
stalkerware and help victims gather evidence? Or can we do something
else.</p>

<p>Ransomware is making a comeback and attacking us all! Learn and
sharpen your blades in order to defend against this multi headed
monster! There’s a lot to learn from every ransomware attack. By
demounting every bit of the attack and looking at every stage there’s
much to gain for setting up proper detection and other defence
techniques</p>
<p>Remember those times when a popup appeared on your screen with the
message to immediately transfer an amount of bitcoins to retrieve your
files? Ransomware is still a serious threat to a lot of people and
organisations and nowadays using more and more advanced techniques to
target you and steal your data. This talk will tell us what Ransomware
actually is, who’s writing the code and making money out of it, it shows
us a bit of the Ransomware history and what types were out there, to
better understand what we’re dealing with. And explain all of the
ransomware attack stages and what you can do in terms of detection and
defence inside your security operations.</p>

<p>Modern electronic locks are often optimized for cost, not security.
Or their manufacturers don’t do security research. Or they ignore it.
For whatever reason, many current electronic lock systems are
susceptible to surprisingly simple attacks. We’ll look at some of them,
and at the underlying basics, so that you can do your own research.</p>
<p>In this talk, we look at a number of modern electronic locks and
their security flaws. Surprisingly many current systems are susceptible
to very simple attacks, like the equivalent of using bump keys. Of
course, there are electronic and/or SW-based attacks, too. We’ll look at
some of them, and at the underlying basics, so that you can do your own
research. Some of the problems have been fixed by manufacturers, but
typically only for future production runs, so you will get some
practical advice on how to test your own hardware for these critical
flaws.</p>

<p>A lack of VoLTE standardisation breaks voice calling globally. Your
brand new smartphone may not work because VoLTE is screwed up by
manufacturers and carriers. Voice-over-LTE (4G), voice-over-NR (5G) and
voice-over-WiFi have been standardized for years, but now that more and
more 2G and 3G networks are shut down by operators, users discover their
phones don't work anymore with basic voice calling. The cause is a
massive mess in standardization, with a boatload of options and settings
and vendors and carriers interpreting it differently, masked by
fall-back to 2G and 3G and lack of "international roaming" agreements
for VoLTE. Handset manufacturers decided to implement shortcuts
(neglecting parts of the standards) or even worse, implementing
white-lists with only mayor operators included, so you cannot switch
operators anymore and are up for a big surprise while roaming in another
country. The result: Even your brand new phone might be unable to
provide voice calling in one country but work in another. Voice-calling
might work if you're lucky, but you cannot reach 112/911, the eCALL
system in your car fails after 2G/3G shutdown or you cannot receive an
SMS you need for remote Two-Factor-Authentication while roaming in
another country. It's such a disastrous mess, so should we stop the
2G/3G shutdown and get-it-fixed?</p>
<p>This is a tale of a disaster still looming in most of Europe for
Europeans, as 2G/3G still works as the fall-back mode of your device. As
a result nobody noticed that VoLTE was screwed up. However many
non-Americans roaming with their phones into the USA suddenly learn
their brand new phone isn't working for voice-calls, as AT&amp;T has
shut down 2G/3G on July 1st 2022. Problems already did happen to users
roaming into countries like India. Users who buy seemingly the same
recent model of a supplier like Samsung or Apple, and think they are
safe, might be up for a big suprise too. Months of testing needed per
device was considered way too cumbersome and too expensive by many, so
at best it was halfway done. Manufacturers decided to cope with it by
curtailing the myriad of options and settings, included
mobile-network-code white-lists or implement short-cuts (neglecting
parts of the standards). With white-lists you suddenly are tied to an
operator and changing your subscription from a major Mobile Network
Operator to an MVNO, makes voice-calling on your brand new smartphone
defunct, only allowing data communications working. The "advice" to
complainers is just to use voice-apps, but these don't allow Emergency
calls. eCALL devices built into cars that dial emergency numbers may
work in your home country, but fail when driving in another land on your
holiday. Roaming agreements between international carriers have up to
now been made only between major operators in large countries, There are
merely 50 international VoLTE roaming agreements actually working. If
you are from a "small country" like Sweden, you're out of luck in the
USA. Voice-over-LTE (4G), voice-over-NR (5G) and voice-over-WiFi have
been screwed up by an unholy alliance of handset manufacturers,
carriers, the GSM-Association and IMS-core vendors and standardization
bodies, who couldn't decide to settle VoLTE down to a limited set of
options and prescribe large scale compulsory plugfests and compatibility
tests. Regulators have looked away, expecting the "magic of the market
would resolve all issues". Some vendors have engaged in favoritism with
white-listing or don't deal with MVNOs and MVNEs, as they don't order
millions of devices. This talk explains the cause of the mess and
highlights the problems lurking in your brand new device. It provides
real problems, with devices and disfunctional VoLTE, collected in
2021/2022. We should ask the question whether the announced shutdowns of
2G/3G in most of Europe have to be stopped. Must device manufacturers
and carriers be forced to clean-up their act now, and halt their
anti-competitive practices and favoritism, before people die as they
cannot reach 112/911 during an Emergency?</p>

<p>Tired of clothing stores not having your size, or that you're stuck
in between sizes? So was Joost de Cock, he didn't - and doesn't - like
how clothing stores base their clothing sizes on an imaginary average
person; every person has a different body. That got him to found
FreeSewing: the open-source platform that translates custom measurements
into well-fitting sewing patterns with code.</p>
<p>The platform is working towards becoming the Wikipedia of sewing
patterns, with new patterns being released every few months, plus a
bunch of guides on how to sew. The platform also provides guides for
designers and developers, to transform patterns into code.</p>
<p>This system based on code allows not only for custom measurements,
but also for tweaking the pattern (e.g. longer sleeves, or a crop top)
and recycling parts of one pattern into another - whereas a traditional
sewing pattern is based on the measurements of a perfect mannequin,
which is then graded up and down for different body types, which is
known to have many downsides.</p>
<p>This talk will not be held by founder Joost de Cock himself, but by
an enthusiastic contributor. He will gladly go more in depth on how the
code works, common pitfalls, the motivation behind it and how it helps
against the rise of fast fashion - maybe encouraging some to pick up
sewing themselves?</p>
<p>A platform that can make tailored sewing patterns, it sounds great -
but how does it work exactly?</p>
<p>It definitely is an upgrade from traditional sewing patterns. Making
sewing patterns may sound easy: they are pieces of fabric, shaped in a
specific way and sewn in a specific way. For example, a t-shirt pattern
will have these parts: a front, a back and sleeves. But to figure out
the right shape, the average pattern designer will make their design
based on the shape of their perfect mannequin, and they grade it up and
down for different body types. Adapting the pattern for a different
shape can be a tedious task. That's where FreeSewing comes into play:
sewing patterns aren't based on the measurements of one fit model, but
they're parameters; they vary based on what the user puts into the
system.</p>
<p>And the platform doesn't just provide sewing patterns; it also has a
lot of guides available, for general sewing, specific sewing patterns
and even on how to code a pattern into the system. This makes it not
just a platform for sewists, but also for designers and developers.</p>
<p>So, enough about how cool I think it is, what exactly do I mean with
"sewing patterns based on code"? FreeSewing is written in JavaScript and
the technique is quite similar to how you would draw a traditional
pattern: a bunch of lines for the right measurements, but now a system
is drawing those lines for you. A line needs a beginning point and an
end point, usually also points that determine the curve; the
'coordinates' of these points are based on the measurements.</p>
<p>The sewing patterns aren't just based on custom measurements, but you
can also tweak them however you'd like (and within what's possible),
e.g. wanting longer sleeves, or a crop top. Another advantage of having
code as a base is that you can 'recycle' pattern parts from one sewing
pattern into another.</p>
<p>Not just the sewing patterns are easily accessible online, but also
the software needed to create the code: the core library and patterns
are available both for NodeJS and the browser. The code and markdown
content is hosted by <a
href="https://github.com/freesewing/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>I'm happy that this project wasn't created by a capitalist overlord,
but by someone who wanted to change the world for the better. Now there
are a lot of sewing patterns available for all types of bodies and I
hope it will encourage more people to start sewing their own clothes.
Sewing is difficult to learn, not to mention coding, but it's so worth
it. Luckily FreeSewing has a vibrant community where there's always
someone ready to help with problems. My goal is to share this enthusiasm
with others and maybe encourage some to pick up sewing or help out with
coding.</p>

<p>A tale of sketchy<sup>H</sup>H<sup>H</sup>H<sup>H</sup>H^Hawesome
online shopping, grimy scrap bins, and crazy DIY projects: The
adventures of a few friends who set up an electron-microscopy lab (and
much more!) without breaking the bank. For all audiences: whether you
just want to see some cool micrographs, hear a story of hacker
adventure, or, want to set up your own SEM - this should be a good
time.</p>
<p>This talk will have several parts:</p>
<p>First we will tell you a story of a hobby that started with modifying
an old classroom microscope for semiconductor imaging and has led to
owning one, possibly two scanning electron microscopes (SEMs). You will
see how 2020's logistics drama, COVID, language barriers, etc resulted
turned the "simple" task of buying an electron microscope into a roller
coaster of an adventure.</p>
<p>Part two will look at the things we learned and what <em>you</em>
should look out for if you want to get your own SEM: Things that will
break, physics to watch out for, requirements for running it, and
understanding the things that set different SEMs apart.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to look at the future: Can we get a community of
hackers building their own chips or replicating material science papers
similar to the one we see abroad? Their achievements have been
non-trivial to translate to European reality, but not impossible to. We
hope to spur this on.</p>

<p>We all know that the value of pi is a constant with a particular
immutable value. Anyone who has done any graphical programming also
knows that visual rendering relies not just on pi but trigonometry more
broadly as well as other mathematical techniques. If we look into the
source code of the first person shooter Doom we find that the value of
pi used in the game is wrong. In this talk I will explore what happens
when we subtly and not so subtly break math in the source.</p>
<p>Doom is a well known classic first person shooter game with source
code released under the GPL in 1999. In this talk I will begin by
exploring what happens to the game when we make the value of pi even
more wrong. What about when we change other trigonometric functions and
constants to incorrect values? How will our familiar understanding and
ability to traverse this virtual world change when we do this. Are there
any interesting gaming possibilities with non-Euclidean geometries? A
brief segway will cover some optimization tricks made to enable the game
to run well on hardware available at the time. At the end I will provide
a link to other games and public source code repositories that also use
an incorrect value of pi. Pointers will also be provided to allow the
audience to compile their own incorrect math version of the game.</p>

<p>What happens when your home is “smart” before you even move in? More
and more buildings are pre-installing smart devices that tenants didn’t
ask for and may not want. These devices focus on comfort and
convenience, an excellent focus as long as security is also considered.
Given the deep integration these devices have, a vulnerable system could
lead to devastating consequences like the loss of privacy and even
unauthorized access. As a security researcher, these were my thoughts
when I saw the tablet mounted on the wall of my new apartment.</p>
<p>In a short period, I discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the
system. A concern for sure, considering the system allows for remote
access and has integration with services in my apartment and the
building. This talk will cover my path, my process, and coverage of the
vulnerabilities I discovered.</p>
<p>The smart home system is based on a wall-mounted Android tablet, and
is installed in thousands of properties throughout Europe. It allows for
controlling lights, heating, motorized blinds, opening a building's main
entrance door among other things.</p>

<p>Ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you click buy on
that domain for a new side project that'll definitely happen (you will
get to it eventually, right)? Well this is the talk for you! We'll cover
all the extremely cursed details of how exactly one sells and manages a
domain, the standards for this (or lack thereof), and some pointers for
how you could get started managing your own domains directly, if you're
not completely put off by this talk's contents.</p>
<p>Back at the start of lockdown in 2020 I think we where all a bit
bored at home with not much to do; well, me and a friend decided it
would be a good idea to start a domain registrar (big mistake, big,
huge). This is the tale of how that went, what we learn, and why you
might not want to do it yourself.</p>
<p>We'll cover the technical aspects of how a domain is actually managed
by your registrar, touch on the absolutely crazy business structures of
the domain world with the likes of ICANN and friends, and how we ended
up in this situation. Some of the standards are extremely cursed, some
are extremely old, most are both. We'll also cover more recent
developments in the domain space, such as the move from WHOIS to RDAP,
and improvements in DNSSEC deployment.</p>
<p>And finally after all that if you decide that somehow this is
something you want more of in your life we'll give some pointers for how
one might setup their own registrar, especially if they want to take
greater control of their own domains, or just have some fun.</p>

<p>This presentation will includes insights in starting your own online
pirate radiostation, the mathematics of bingo cards, keeping
participants data up to GDPR standards, Fitbit-statistics, and the
optimization of bingo winner-calculations. This presentation will also
at one point include a guy in an ice cream cone costume with an
offensive name, as well as an optional disco bingo party with songs
supplied by visitors to the conference.</p>
<p>As the first Covid lockdown made it impossible to continue hosting
live events in pubs, many presenters and questioneers quickly adapted to
hosting online quizzes. Slightly depressed by the notion that online
quizzes would involve a great amount of cheating and the thought that
participants would see it as an “okay substitute for the offline
version”, I choose to develop an online event that would be impossible
to cheat and would give people a unique experience, whilst still being a
game that can also be played in pubs.</p>
<p>When this presentation is held, there will have been at least 200
installments of DJ Cone Yo’s online Discobingo, with over 5.000
participants on all 6 continents, all from a laptop on a nightstand next
to my bed. It proved to be an event accessible to both Children as well
as high-level employees of companies such as Deloitte, PWC, Gemeente
Amsterdam, and then some.</p>
<p>Please note that this will not be a presentation on any personal
accomplishment with this event. Because let’s be honest: it’s a guy
doing digital conga shuffles in front of the webcam. However, during the
development of this activity I learned how to build up an https online
radio server with Icecast2, created calculation models in excel to
manufacture unique cards, optimized this data to supply me predictive
data to rapidly check results, and created a way to supply participants
with all information, including unique cards, whilst living up to
GDPR-standards. With this presentation I’d like to provide some
inspiration regarding how to develop each of these things without any
knowledge of programming and using some of the most basic pieces of
software. Also: share the joy of bingo math.</p>
<p>There is an option to also do a shared evening activity. People can
supply songs for an evening discobingo which can be played in multiple
locations at the same time. So if there are any restrictions still set,
the radio stream can be played in tents or in smaller groups, and
everyone that wishes to join can receive a unique card and play along.
In the spirit of the event, people can even submit their own prizes to
the bingo as to share them with others at the festival.</p>
<p>And on a personal note: After visiting SHA2017 back when I was
working as a campaign strategist for Bits of Freedom (where I got to
design campaigns such as the Rijksveiligheidsdienst) I have thought
about how amazing it would be to do a presentation at one of these
events. Back then, me and a few colleagues specifically enjoyed a
presentation on “how to start an escape room”. Doing something along
these lines and sharing insights gained from developing entertainment is
something I am good at.</p>

<p>A series of isolated problems encountered when attempting to fuzz
software, in this case Adobe Reader (DC), and hackish solutions to said
problems. Constructing a fuzzing pipeline capable of finding real bugs
by stringing together freely available tools creating the bare minimum
of glue.</p>
<p>Starting from target selection, moving over requirements for a given
fuzzing campaign to smart input generation, briefly touching on scaling
challenges and performance issues. This presentation describes a
practical approach to creating a fuzzing pipeline with the purpose of
finding real world bugs in closed source software, in this case Adobe
Reader (dc). The approach taken is suitable for anyone with basic
scripting capabilities, is easy to replicate, and leads to bug hunting
capabilities without a doctoral degree or years of experience in
vulnerability discovery.</p>

<p>Greenpeace is a direct action organisation. We have been doing
physical direct civil disobedience actions for 50 years now. Civil
disobedience has always played an important part in evolving democratic
society if you look for instance at womens’ voting rights, the civil
rights movement in the US and de ‘klimaatspijbelaars’. The digital realm
is becoming more and more important in all of our lives. That is why we
are working on a research project on what digital civil disobedience can
look like. This is something else than mere ‘clicktivism’. What are the
differences and similarities of online and offline civil disobedience?
How do you 'drop' a digital banner or how do we digitally 'occupy' a
building or mine? During this talk we want to tell about this project
and give you an insight look on how we prepare disobedient actions at
Greenpeace.</p>
<p>Greenpeace is a direct action organisation. We have been doing direct
civil disobedient actions for over 40 years now. At Greenpeace we know
our strength and our weaknesses when doing actions in physical spaces.
We scale buildings and hang banners, we have blocked the petrol harbour
in Rotterdam (multiple times) and we stop oil/gas rigs from operating.
All these kinds of actions are part of a struggle for a healthy climate
and safe planet to live on and so ideologically motivated.</p>
<p>The right to protest is a fundamental European right, a right that is
very dear to us and important when chased by the law. At Greenpeace we
always look at new ways to do disobedient actions. This is why we
started a research on how online actions can contribute to campaigns.
The last few months we have been looking into the possibilities of
digital civil disobedience actions. We looked at the risks, the actions
and the possibilities it will bring. One thing we learned is that
everyone we talk to about this topic is super excited.</p>

<p>This discussion will start with a brief summary on the history of
repair initiatives. We can report about our personal repair activities
during the pandemic. Subsequently, I'll outline the achievements of the
right to repair movement and we can discuss ideas for the future.</p>
<p>During a peak in public interest, the repair café movement was caught
by the covid pandemic. Many local initiatives adapted quickly and opened
online repair consultation hours. In the german-speaking countries, a
monthly central online repair café was established. I'll give a
lessons-learned about the experiences and limits of these online
activities. The political right to repair movement has brought many
interesting improvements, for example the french repairability index or
the European ecodesign directive. I'll talk about them and what else is
to be expected in the near future. This is in interactive discussion
format, so ideally I'll only present a few facts and guide through
topics while the audience chimes in with their personal experiences and
questions.</p>

<p>The HomeComputerMuseum's idea originated in 2016 and opened the doors
in 2018. Since then, we faced several challenges but we came out on the
other end and became one of the largest museums about computers with an
award-winning social impact, an enormous social network, collaborations
over the whole world and even are of essential importance to the Dutch
government. The talk is about the original concept, how we build it to
what it is now.</p>
<p>The original concept of the HomeComputerMuseum is a hands-on
computermuseum dedicated to the home computer or connected computers.
Because a museum is a terrible businessplan I decided to create a few
services, like repairs, selling overstock and reading old media. For
this could not be done by one person, I decided to have people with
autism help me by simply not putting a label on them. The businessplan
was created and eventually a building was rented. The entire museum is
physically built in 7 days (not even kidding) and we were off to a very
rough start and even balancing on the edge of bankruptcy. However, we
managed to stay afloat and we even moved to a much better and bigger
building where we enjoyed for a full month before corona hit the museum.
As an unsubsidized museum and without big sponsors we were faced a brand
new challenge. But we overcame and grew stronger than ever…. (and then
there's plenty of story to tell more).</p>

<p>The current digital educational system is dominated by tech giants.
Fundamental rights, like the privacy, freedom and sovereignty of
children, parents and educators are insufficiently secured. Ed-tech is
mainly closed source and full of vendor lockins. Products are either
overpriced, harvesting data, or both. The time to replace surveillance
capitalist based Ed-tech by ethical open source alternatives is now. And
our coalition for fair digital education is going to do it.</p>
<p>Private companies do not have the same interests as public
institutions like schools. Schools do not have the time, knowledge or
budget to hack their own IT environment together. Hence, BigTech and
Ed-Tech fix this problem for schools, by offering services that have a
very low price tag in euro's, but the actual payment is in data: meta
data, "service"-data and user-data. DPIA you say? <em>(Detailed Privacy
Impact Analysis)</em> That will achieve sort-of-legally compliant
services at max. If only the authorities would actually bite, but alas,
enforcement is lax, and four years of GDPR and the IT environment in
schools is still riddled with privacy risks. Essential online services
are out-of-scope of the DPIA's and purposes like "product improvement"
(read: feeding AI and machine learning algorithms) is GDPR-Okay. If you
or your kid goes to a 'Google school' and is forced to use a Chromebook,
you'll be producing data to train Google, and you will be trained to
love Google services. Consequently children won't develop core digital
skills or a critical attitude toward digital services.</p>
<p>Thus, there is a huge gap between core values of big tech companies
versus public values in the educational system. Therefore, enforcement
to make Big Tech embrace those public values will never be effective.
​​​​​​​That is why we need to build a school IT environment based upon public
values: transparent, open source, privacy-by-design, decentralized, fair
and respecting our digital sovereignty. Our coalition for fair digital
education is going to build this. This is a huge project and a lot of
work, so join us.</p>

<p>Using cryptography can give you easy assurances, keep data
confidential and keep prying eyes from stuff where they should not
be.</p>
<p>However it's not magic. This talk is intended for programmers, users
and software designers.</p>
<p>This talk is about hardcore mathematics while you should not have to
understand what the mathematics are but what they do.</p>
<p>What does cryptography do: encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify. How are
certificates used in cryptogaphy and why are they totally not a magical
thing.</p>
<p>It covers what cool hardware is available, open design and open
source, hardware tokens and how to use TPM for cool features.</p>
<p>And last but not least: it contains best practices and warnings.
After this talk you might be able to see what's snakeoil and what is
real.</p>
<p>== NFT's are a scam. If you are into crypto-bullshit please stay
away. ==</p>
<p>Cryptography seems like magic anytime you at first look at it. In the
past years I have been helping a lot of projects and customers with my
more-than-basic knowledge about applied cryptography.</p>
<p>I'll talk about: * What is cryptography (basic math) - encryption -
decryption - digital signatures - digital signature verification * What
can it do for you? - Deliver security - Deliver privacy - Deliver
dataloss * When to use encryption - what cryptography do you want to
build (hint: none) - what cryptography do you want to use (a- or
symetrical encryption). - how do you do key management - where to find
the best practices * About hardware - Provide security - Provide speed -
HSM, TPM, processor and other acceleration * Standards - The good, the
bad, the ugly - Old ones - New ones - Very special ones * Limitations
and workarounds * Software - How to avoid OpenSSL * This all in random()

<p>This workshop will introduce upagekite, an open source
micro-framework for building dynamic, public webapps using Micropython
on the low-cost ESP32 system-on-a-chip.</p>
<p>This session will start with participants plugging the ESP32 (an
ESP32-CAM devkit) into their laptops for the first time, and by the end
of it they will have a running web server on the public Internet -
running in a few hundred KB of RAM on a chip that costs only a few
euro.</p>
<p>The ESP32 is a low-cost system-on-a-chip with built-in support for
bluetooth and WiFi.</p>
<p>Although heavily resource constrained, with only a few hundred KB of
RAM, it is possible to run Micropython on these devices and expose a
live webserver: not just to the local network, but to the public web
using open-source Pagekite reverse proxies.</p>
<p>Topics covered in the workshop will include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Flashing the latest version of Micropython to the chip</li>
<li>Uploading custom Python code</li>
<li>Creating a simple, dynamic webapp which interacts with peripherals,
such as a camera or GPIO</li>
<li>Exposing the webapp to the public web</li>
<li>Security concerns and constraints</li>
</ol>
<p>Advanced topics which may be covered, depending on time and
interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conserving RAM by "freezing" custom Python code into the Micropython
binary</li>
<li>Creating a captive portal for configuring the device on a new
network</li>
</ul>
<p>Workshop requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A laptop: if running Windows, please have WSL or a Linux VM with
access to the USB ports</li>
<li>A data-capable micro-USB cable</li>
<li>Please be familiar with basic use of command-line git and
Python</li>
<li><em>Optional:</em> Bring your own ESP32 dev-board</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants are welcome to bring their own ESP32s, but there will
also be a few (max 25) ESP32-CAM modules handed out as giveaways (yes,
you can keep it if you want), on a first-come, first-served basis. If we

<p>Protect our patients from healthcare hacks! The increasing
availability of telemetric medical devices has great potential to
improve patient care. Yet, smart medical devices are hackable and
previous case studies have described the life threatening implications
of healthcare hacks. We invite you to a workshop run by doctors who are
looking for your input on a series of commonly used telemetric medical
technologies. Help us improve patient care by exploring potential
vulnerabilities and solutions.</p>
<p>Telemetric medical devices can enhance patient care by improving
symptom detection and disease treatment through the delivery of timely
and responsive interventions (e.g., wireless glucose monitoring devices
for diabetic patients). Yet, the increasing adoption of wireless medical
devices in healthcare settings and the consumer environment puts
patients at risk of ‘healthcare hacks’.</p>
<p>We present a number of wireless medical devices currently in use and
ask you to consider the vulnerabilities of these technologies to hack
attacks: 1. Diabetes glucose sensors 2. Hearing aids 3. Cardiac Monitors
4. Pain relief voltage devices 5. Virtual Patient Beds</p>
<p>Each of these devices connect remotely to a monitoring device,
exposing them to malicious digital manipulation. So far, two case
studies have described the vulnerabilities of these systems. One report
described the remote hijacking of an insulin pump and another described
the manipulation of an implanted cardiac device [1-3]. Increasingly,
research is describing the security and privacy risks of telemetric and
implanted medical devices to patients. In particular, ‘closed loop’
systems that alter device settings based on real-time physiological
signals do not require clinician or patient input, and are therefore
particularly vulnerable to unnoticed manipulation. Without proper
security, smart medical devices are breachable and can have
life-threatening consequences for the patient.</p>
<p>We invite you to our workshop to discuss, in short groups, the listed
devices and their vulnerability to manipulation. As medical doctors, we
will highlight the range of clinical syndromes which may arise from
these hacks and will discuss how they may be recognised in clinical
settings.</p>
<p>Lastly, we will consider the vulnerability of the healthcare concept
of ‘The Virtual Patient’. Due to high hospital occupancy following the
COVID19 pandemic, ‘Virtual Beds’ - which allow physicians to monitor
patients in the community - have been suggested as an alternative policy
for relieving pressure from healthcare services. The management of the
‘virtual patient’ relies heavily on telemetry devices and medical
database systems. We will discuss the vulnerability of the specific
devices listed above, in addition to the wider concept of ‘virtual
patient care’.</p>
<p>Questions for workshop participants would include: (i)
Vulnerabilities: How would you hack a smart medical device or what
attacks is it likely to encounter? (ii) Defense: What are device
vulnerabilities and what options could improve the security of these
devices? (iii) Ethics: What are the arguments for and against these
devices being used in healthcare?</p>

<p>Our present discourse of trauma is commonly associated with
significant events like war, sexual or physical violence - but there is
a glaringly missing conversation about how living in other kinds of
societal precariousness (like capitalism) affects our behaviours,
attitudes and beliefs. This is also trauma, because trauma is not the
event that happens to us, but the way we become psychologically
organised around fear. I want to explore financial trauma as an example,
and analyse its relationship with how it shows up in technological
systems.</p>
<p>Despite most discourse about money being hyper-rational - 90% of all
financial behaviours are made emotionally. Financial trauma is an
experience shared near-universally by people regardless of income class
- and is a critically under-explored topic when designing new
systems.</p>
<p>There is so much potential in our new dreams of better technological
systems - in decentralisation, Web3, in tech bringing better lives to
people comparing to older exploitative models. However, if we don’t
fundamentally understand how people psychologically interact with money,
and how negative experiences have shaped our behaviour - we are not
going to be able to create systems that promote the financial wellbeing
we dream of.</p>
<p>In this workshop, I’ll be analysing what financial trauma is, how it
impacts our behaviour, how it shows up in digital financial systems -
and open up a conversation on how we design real ‘circuit breakers’
based on real holistic financial wellbeing.</p>

<p>Hacking = playing. Let me take you along in this playshop to discover
and experience the power of a playful mind and the science behind it. In
this Playshop we will Play ourselves a way through a lot of the
scientific proof about the positive effects of embedding it in your day
to day life. Playful people are more creative, have more fun and are
overall more happy and joyful. Come to this session and unlearn this
stupid idea that playing is for children!</p>
<p>Playing is proven to be crucial for learning, innovating and
mentoring. And thus a fundamental tool for any hacker or maker out
there. I rediscovered playing, made my job out of it and I would love to
take you on a journey with an inspirational, interactive and pragmatic
session to do so too (or even more)</p>
<p>There was a time in your life where you stopped playing. Or you
probably didn’t. What’s up with the idea that playing is childish? Why
do we ignore all the great scientific proof that playing is the best way
to learn? This is a personal story about finding out what I need to do,
combined with evidence based knowledge.</p>
<p>The take aways of this playshop are: – 7 most important scientific
reasons why you should encourage playing in a professional setting. –
The difference between playing and gaming. – 3 tips to start tomorrow. –
A shitload of games which we will play and you can use yourself 🙂 (I
even have a CYBER! Game!)</p>

<p>Scratch is a awesome language and tool to get started with
programming in a playful and creative way. This workshop is intended for
complete beginners as well as those who already have some experience
with Scratch.</p>
<p>Not able to attend the workshop? Follow the steps on the field or at
home: https://scratch.cmptr.nl</p>
<hr />
<p>Scratch is een geweldige taal en een programma om aan de slag te gaan
met programmeren door een beetje creatief te klooien. Deze workshop is
bedoeld voor zowel beginners als mensen die al wat ervaring met Scratch
hebben.</p>
<p>Kan je er niet bij zijn? Je kan de stappen ook op het veld of wanneer
je terug thuis bent volgen: https://scratch.cmptr.nl</p>
<p>You'll learn the basics by creating an example game. After that, use
your creativity and problem solving skills to make the game unique with
your own rules and graphics. Ask around for help or to get advice on how
to add a next challenge.</p>
<p>If you already have some experience with Scratch, you can also learn
how to create beautifully colored fractal curves. In a few steps, you'll
create Scratch code that will use itself (recursion) to draw a pattern
that has the same properties, no matter how much you zoom in.</p>
<h5 id="practical-information">Practical information</h5>
<ul>
<li>The workshop will be a mix of English and Dutch, and you can read a
bit in both languages. Händen und Füßen will be used if necessary.</li>
<li>You need to bring your own computer or tablet that connects to the
internet. Don't forget to charge the battery and bring someone to help
you with carrying and using it if necessary.</li>
<li>You can use Scratch with almost any computer or tablet that runs an
internet browser. Try: https://scratch.mit.edu/create. Bigger, brighter,
upright screens work best.</li>
<li>Scratch was designed for ages 8 and up. It could be good to bring
someone to help you out. Solving programming challenges together can be
a lot of fun.</li>
<li>You can do the workshop at home as well, via
https://scratch.cmptr.nl</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nederlands">Nederlands</h3>
<p>Leer de basis door een voorbeeldspelletje te maken. Gebruik daarna je
creativiteit en vindingrijkheid om je spel uniek te maken met eigen
regels, afbeeldingen en animaties. Vraag rond voor hulp of om advies te
krijgen om een volgende uitdaging aan je spel toe te voegen.</p>
<p>Als je al wat ervaring met Scratch hebt kan je ook leren hoe je
prachtig gekleurde fractals kan maken. In een paar stappen maak je
Scratch-code die zichzelf gebruikt (recursie) om een patroon te tekenen
die steeds dezelfde eigenschappen heeft, hoe ver je ook inzoomt.</p>
<h5 id="praktische-informatie">Praktische informatie</h5>
<ul>
<li>De workshop zal een mix van Engels en Nederlands zijn, en je kan
iets lezen in beide talen.</li>
<li>Neem je eigen computer of tablet met internetverbinding mee. Vergeet
'm niet op te laden, en neem iemand mee die je helpt met dragen en
gebruiken als dat nodig is.</li>
<li>Scratch werkt op bijna elke computer of tablet met een
internetbrowser. Probeer: https://scratch.mit.edu/create. Grotere,
heldere schermen die rechtop staan werken het beste.</li>
<li>Scratch is ontworpen voor 8 jaar en ouder. Het kan helpen om iemand
mee te nemen om je te assisteren. Samen programmeeruitdagingen oplossen
kan erg leuk zijn.</li>
<li>De workshop is ook thuis te volgen via https://scratch.cmptr.nl</li>

<p>The vision of a quantum internet is to enhance existing Internet
technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on
Earth. Such a quantum internet will—in synergy with the “classical”
internet that we have today—connect quantum information processors in
order to achieve unparalleled capabilities that are provably impossible
by using only classical information, such as distributing encryption
keys secured by the laws of quantum mechanics, more efficient
distributed agreement, or private delegated quantum computation. The
first quantum entanglement networks have been realised in a lab
including a software and network protocol stack for executing
platform-independent applications. In this workshop we will introduce
the basic concepts underpinning the quantum internet and take you
through developing your own quantum network application running on a
(for now) simulated quantum internet using the Quantum Network Explorer
platform.</p>
<p>This workshop consists of two parts;</p>
<p>First, a basic introduction to quantum networks. Here, I will
introduce the basic building blocks of a quantum internet: quantum bits
(qubits), entanglement, and quantum repeaters. I will then explain the
quantum mechanical phenomena that enable greater security for
communication and how entanglement is a fundamentally new resource for
distributed tasks and computation.</p>
<p>Secondly, to illustrate these concepts, I will take the audience
through an implementation of a simple Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
application whereby Alice and Bob create a quantum-secured secret key
which they can use to encrypt their communication. This will be done in
Python using the tools available on the Quantum Network Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong>: You need a machine with Linux and
Python &lt;= 3.9 (some of the packages have not been updated to 3.10).
You may use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (Bash on Ubuntu) if you have
a Windows machine. MacOS is in principle supported, but often causes
issues due to certain dependencies that do not work on MacOS. In this
case, you are advised to have Linux installed in a virtual machine.</p>

<p>Human interactions can be messy - especially in groups. Who doesn't
know the situation where the loudest/most eloquent/charismatic person
gets to dominate the conversation or the HIPPO effect. Or we have
battles of two opponents/opinions, with the rest of the group watching
in terror or shutting off. How about that awkward silence in a big group
where nobody wants to go first, the terror of going in a circle and
being expected to be able to contribute at just that moment when it is
your turn? and let's not forget you might want to include more than 5-8
people in an interaction. Sitting in a circle and distributing time
equally just won't work.</p>
<p>There is a better way, and it is easy and fun.</p>

<p>The Interplanetary Filesystem is an API and network for locating and
fetching content-addressed data. This workshop will provide an
interactive space to build applications using content addressed data,
and provide guidance on potential decentralized answers to some common
types of communication patterns.</p>
<p>Do you want to build a website or service without needing centrally
hosted or managed infrastructure?</p>
<p>This workshop will guide you through first creating and hosting a
static website stored in the <a href="https://ipfs.io">Interplanetary
Filesystem</a>, and then explore the possibilities for active
communication patterns that can be realized in a decentralized fashion.
We hope to shed some light into what's possible today, what's actively
being worked on, and where help is needed.</p>
<p>Content addressed data is able to address a large range of needs
today, and offers valuable integrity and ownership guarantees when
compared with the traditional client-server model. While IPFS has made
large strides in usability, there remain many places where the mental
model is different from a client-server model. This workshop will
provide grounding in how IPFS functions and can be employed to build a
decentralized service.</p>

<p>Let's talk about our projects and surroundings, and how their setup
may be discrimnating. Let's find barriers, and think about ways of to
remove or bypass them. Whether it's about your hackspace being way too
white and able-bodied, your IT project being too male-dominated, or your
leftist intiative somehow being very non-working class: let's find a way
to figure this out and make your surroudings more diverse and
equitable.</p>
<p>The target group for this workshop is primarily people working
in/with tech, and there is no need to know sociology theories to keep
up.</p>
<p>This talk covers the work that I have done for my master's thesis. I
looked at how (in Human Computer Interaction) projects tackled different
forms of discrimination not by the stuff that they created, but rather
by how they went about it. From writing proposals to deciding on which
methods to use (and how), to documenting the work afterwards: there's
lots of things we can do to be more inclusionary.</p>
<p>In this workshop, I will present a set of recommendations that I have
created for the purpose of helping non-social sciences people be better
in including people that are different to them (tech people still are a
rather homogenous group of white, affluent, cis non-inter men). After
the presentation, we will apply said recommendations to whichever
projects the participants would like to – ideally, they bring their own
(with a short explanation), or we come up with some fictional
setting.</p>

<p>Last year we developed an Ubuntu Touch Application Development
training and printed a training book. In this workshop our trainer Felix
and assistant Terence will help you with your first steps developing for
Ubuntu Touch, right on your own laptop! We have material to fill 2 days,
so it will never get boring. If you already have Docker pre-installed on
your laptop the startup should be quick. The first 30 participants will
receive their own copy of the Ubuntu Touch App dev book for free!</p>
<p>The last year we had a team of professionals combined with community
members to work on developing app development training material for the
UBports mobile device OS. In this workshop we will use the course
material we have developed the past year and help people to create apps
that run on the Ubuntu Touch mobile device OS. We will start with a
simple grocery-list application and take it from there. Time permitting
we will add making rest calls and doing stuff with media to the
contents. We have material to fill 2 days, so it will never get
boring.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gopass.pw/">Gopass</a> is a password manager
based on PGP or age, that allows you to easily manage your passwords but
also your team's passwords in a way that's fully transparent, easy to
backup, easy to monitor and easy to use. It supports hardware tokens
such as Yubikeys, it allows you to setup versioning using git easily and
supports multiple "stores" from different remotes. It integrates very
nicely with a command line based approach and dmenu plus xdotools make
it a breeze to use (unless you prefer to rely on the dedicated browser
extension).</p>

<p>In this workshop, we will walk through the "password issue", the hope
for a better future and see what are our best options nowadays.</p>
<p>Finally, we will go through the setup of the password manager of your
choice, I highly recommend choosing Gopass, learn about good practices
with passwords and (if you brought yours) setup your password store
using a hardware token if possible.</p>
<p>Bring you own laptop and a <strong>USB stick</strong> (for proper
backup and recovery purposes). Notice that running Linux is the best way
to fully benefit from Gopass, but MacOS and Windows are also (somewhat)
supported. Please, if you have one (even already in use for something
else), bring your Yubikey 4+ with you, since you can easily increase
your password store's security using it.</p>
<p>You can also come if you'd like to enhance your existing password
store setup, or if you need help migrating your existing password store
over to Gopass.</p>

<p>Using a DIY conductive dough/clay you will create your own creatures
and adorn them with working (basic) electronics like LED's and buzzers.
Always wanted to create a snail with blinking lights? Or a lovely heart
with lights? This is your chance! This workshop is aimed at kids (4 -
10yrs) Supervision of an adult is required. The dough uses food coloring
and is made using basic food ingredients. Food allergies? Check the
recipe in our repository before taking part!</p>
<p>Using nothing but basic kitchen ingredients (flour, salt, lemon
juice, vegetable oil) we will create a conductive dough (clay) in
different colors (using food coloring). Combined with a battery pack
(6Volts) the dough is conductive enough due to the salt and lemon juice
(and therefor also not edible) to power LED's and a simple buzzer.</p>
<p>You will be able to sculpt your own creations. Add basic electronics
like LED's and buzzers and make them come alive! This workshop is aimed

<p>In this workshop, we will learn how to assemble tiny parts on circuit
boards by building an electronic touch-activated purring kitten. Anyone
can do it. Yes, even you who never touched anything electronic before.
Takes 120mins, 20€/kit, avoid caffeine immediately before. Max 10
participants per session, sign up on PAPER at the Hardware Hacking
Area.</p>
<p>Takes about two hours. Basic workshop. No prior knowledge needed.
Materials cost 20€ per kit.</p>
<p>We are going to build an electronic kitten using tiny tiny SMD parts.
It will purr when you touch it right and hiss when you touch it wrong.
It's going to work. You will learn how to make your hands not shake at
all ever. You will learn how to activate your builtin precision
positioning superpowers.</p>
<p>For people afraid of surface mount assembly/rework. You know those
tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible
and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you
how!</p>
<p>Think you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s?
Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is
minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to
THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no
longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the
workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The workshop kit costs 20€. Please SIGN UP ON THE PAPER LIST at the
Hardware Hacking Area. PLEASE BE ON TIME!</p>

<p>Ankle monitors are devices typically used by law enforcement to track
offenders, have you ever wondered how they work - which potential
vulnerabilities they have or where to buy one ( or many )? This talk is
about hacking electronic ankle monitors built by various Chinese
manufacturers - and the protocols and software they use.</p>
<p>Ankle monitors are devices used by law enforcement to track offenders
- typically ones on house arrest. They contain various sensors and GPS,
WiFi, Cellular and sometimes RF communication to transmit data and
determine their position.</p>
<p>This talk will go into detail for various brands on how they
communicate with their servers - potential vulnerabilities and ways to
escape/avoid detection. This talk concerns Chinese vendors of ankle
monitors - but the processes are applicable to different brands and
types as well. I will discuss how I developed a server which can be used
with 4 vendors of these devices - and how I got the protocol documents
for each of them through a bit of social engineering.</p>
<p>The focus will be on the technical details of how your location is
determined - which fallbacks are used in case locating falls - and how
data is communicated to the server - and the security implications of
all of this. Some of devices are used by small nations to track for
instance immigrants for COVID tracking - we will discuss the
implications of this.</p>

<p>Electric vehicles present a real opportunity to take a step towards
better designed, more reliable, and sustainable transport. Instead,
electric cars have become nightmarishly complex gadgets whose limited
lifespans will make them less sustainable than a diesel pickuptruck
running on whale oil. This talk will explore the problem, and make a few
suggestions as to what could be done about it.</p>
<p>I want my next car to have an electric motor, I want it to push the
boundaries of what is capable with a battery and I want it to be an
automotive tour de force that represents a real advance over my gasoline
car in terms of lifetime sustainability. The switch to electric cars
represents an opportunity like no other to deliver a new type of car
that doesn’t carry the baggage of what has gone before, but what I see
in the electric cars available to me just doesn't live up to that dream.
The car industry now makes cars that don't rust and don't wear out, so
for planned obsolescence they now rely on technological complexity to
ensure they reach the scrap heap long before their promise of true
sustainability can be realised. This talk will attempt to deconstruct
the problem, and look at how it might be remedied.</p>

find credentials in places where they don't belong, like GitHub and
Postman. And this hobby has gotten him into many places he should not
have, like the Dutch Tax office and many larger company.</p>
<p>But, in February 2022 he found an account with an even bigger reach,
an account who's abuse could mean trouble for our national critical
infrastructure. His simple GitHub query uncovered a secret that could
switch off a country, now what…</p>

them make digital solutions to fight the pandemic. Why was it? What does
this do to a government body like ministry? What does this mean for
privacy, security and the tech choices that are made?</p>
<p>In 2020, when the pandemic started, scientists suggested to also
digitally support fighting the pandemic. One of the suggestions was
digitally supported contact tracing. After first asking the market for
solutions the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport decided to
self build open, privacy friendly, secure and accessible solutions with
help of a large open source community.</p>
<p>When vaccinations became available and timeframes for building
solutions were near impossible the next step was clear: get hackers
involved. This isn’t just to stick to the values, but also to create
solutions in ways that aren’t always common for governments. How do you
hack processes and rules to create what some ministries called
magic?</p>
<p>This talk will tell the inside hacker tale of the pandemic and show
the dilemmas that were overcome. This is a story of hackers in a
ministry at the heat of the moment.</p>

<p>In this presentation, we will be updating the audience on the ongoing
modernization efforts of the software developed inside The Tor Project –
the organization behind the most widely deployed anonymity network. We
will look at upcoming features and changes to the core technology that
drives the Tor network and why a Browser may no longer be the only
product we have to provide for the user-base that is so crucial in need
of Tor's anonymity properties for safe internet access.</p>
<p>The Tor ecosystem is currently going through a more extensive
modernization phase where we are simplifying our goals slightly to make
space for larger projects that we find necessary.</p>
<p>This work includes implementing a new, more memory-safe Tor
implementation in the Rust programming language named Arti. This work
will make it easier for application developers to integrate their
applications and benefit from the safety features that Tor can
provide.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will talk about some recent or upcoming changes to
the network:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give a status update on deploying modern congestion control
algorithms in the Tor network. This work should significantly enhance
the performance barrier that most Tor users experience.</li>
<li>The roadmap towards UDP support in the client and relay software.
This work should allow more modern use-cases of the Tor software such as
voice and video communication, WebRTC, and other protocols that leverage
datagram-based data transfer.</li>
<li>Move to more modern cryptography in Tor's protocols, including
support for Post-quantum cryptography and why this is needed.</li>
<li>Allowing Tor users to access the network using a VPN-like tunneling
mechanism as an alternative to simply web-browsing and other socks5
enabled applications.</li>

<p>Last year we won Pwn2Own by demonstrating remote code execution,
using a chain of three vulnerabilities, on the then latest version of
the Zoom client. In this talk we would like to share all details of the
vulnerabilities we found and how we combined them into a fully working
exploit.</p>
<p>When the pandemic required everyone to work from home, we saw a huge
growth on the video conferencing market. It was this movement that made
the organisation behind the world famous Pwn2Own competition decide to
add an 'Enterprise Communications' category to last year’s competition.
Everyone who was able to successfully demonstrate a zero-day attack
against Zoom or Microsoft Teams would be rewarded $200,000. We decided
to take them up on this challenge and started researching Zoom. This
resulted in a working remote exploit against the at the time latest
version of Zoom that would give the attacker full control over the
victim’s system (CVE-2021-34407).</p>
<p>During this talk, we will walk you through how we started our
research, explain the vulnerabilities that were found and finally how
those vulnerabilities were incorporated into the exploit that
successfully performed the attack during the contest.</p>

<p>Predictive policing is hip and happening. In the last few years we
have seen a number of experiments with predictive policing in The
Netherlands. How does that technology work? What were the outcomes of
the experiments? And what is the legal status of a suspicion generated
by a computer?</p>
<p>"Predictive policing" is the name of a family of technology that use
historical crime data to make predictions about future crimes (cue
Minority Report). Police departments all over the world are very
interested in this technology because it promises better results (more
crimes prevented) at lower cost. In the Netherlands we have seen a
number of experiments with predictive policing, and one of these systems
(CAS) is currently being rolled out throughout the country. But how do
these systems work? And how <em>well</em> do they work? And what is
actually the legal status of a suspicion generated by a computer?</p>
<p>This talk will give discuss relevant predictive policing experiments
in the Netherlands and abroad and will discuss the results of these
experiments. The talk will also cover the legal status of suspicions
generated by this technology in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>IRMA is a system in which you are in control of sharing specific
personal properties (aka attributes) such as your age, address and
gender which are stored in the IRMA app on your phone. Technically, IRMA
is a set of free and open source software projects implementing the
Idemix attribute-based credential scheme. Although the Idemix credential
system has been around for a while it is still relevant today. In this
talk, we walk you through the crypto behind Idemix, explain how it
works, why it is safe and give you the means to understand Gabi, the Go
implementation of Idemix that is used in IRMA.</p>
<p>Presentations on privacy products often focus on the principles of
why we should want to protect our privacy and how the product does this
from a birds-eye or user perspective. In case of IRMA, this focus would
be on storing your attributes on your local device and on the
information flow when the IRMA app is used.</p>
<p>However, in this talk we want to dig deeper, demonstrate the crypto
behind the curtains and give you the means to reason why IRMA is a neat
solution.</p>
<p>Note that the talk is very technical. We will cover the theory of the
zero-knowledge proofs, the Camenisch-Lysyankaya signature and the Idemix
credential verification, all so you can understand the Go implementation
of the Gabi library. If time allows, we'll also cover IRMA-specific
solutions such as the keyshare protocol and revocation.</p>
<p>We will cover a lot of ground very quickly but after this talk you
will have an excellent starting point for truely understanding this
anonymous credential system. Of course we'll provide you with follow-up
material and are happy to chat some more after the talk with a beer or
two.</p>

<p>Governments should be radically more transparent. While calls for
more open data and initiatives like the Open Government Partnership have
existed for more than a decade, there is still much to be desired. Where
do we stand? And, fun to imagine, where could and should we go?</p>
<p>It is hard to have a perfect overview of the status of open
government across the world. We at <a href="https://openstate.eu/">Open
State Foundation</a> focus mostly on accelerating digital transparency
in the Netherlands. We will explain things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is the <strong>Handelsregister</strong> (company register) still
only fully accessible for those with a lot of money?</li>
<li>Why are <strong>Wob-verzoeken</strong> (Freedom of Information
requests) on average not answered within the legal deadline?</li>
<li>How transparent are the <strong>external meetings of
ministers</strong> and who do they talk to?</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand we show why the Netherlands is a great place if you
want to know how your municipalities spend their money or want to access
national statistics.</p>
<p>Still there is much to learn from other countries: - <strong>How does
Norway manage their information so well</strong> that they respond to
Freedom of Information requests much faster? - What country has
<strong>a minister that deals in the most open way with
lobbyists</strong>? - Can governments produce <strong>modern open source
software</strong>? These examples can show us a future of a digitally
transparent democracy.</p>
<p>We end the talk by opening up the floor to the audience and love to
hear about positive examples of transparent forms of governments around
the world.</p>

<p>Hardware attacks on security relevant components, such as fault
injection, have been known for decades and have been shown to be
successful on a wide range of devices ranging from general purpose
microcontrollers to dedicated security engines. In this work we give an
overview of different methods used for fault injection and the
effectiveness of these methods. We discuss electromagnetic fault
injection in more detail. Most of the published research focuses on
attacking low performance secure devices. However, we present the
results of electromagnetic fault injection on a modern multicore system
on chip running at gigahertz speed and discuss its effectiveness.</p>
<p>In this presentation we discuss hardware attacks in general, their
use cases, and real-world examples. We then discuss electromagnetic
fault injection in detail. We compare the results of the previous
research on microcontrollers and secure elements to more modern high
performance system on chip devices. We discuss relevant features of
modern Arm systems on chip and answer the two main questions of this
research. Are electromagnetic fault injection attacks applicable and
efficient when applied to software running at gigahertz speed on a
modern multicore system on a chip? And to what extent does the operating
frequency change the effectiveness of electromagnetic fault injection
attacks?</p>

<p>Nowadays, when a user wants to authenticate mostly centralized
systems, such as DigiD in the Netherlands, are utilized. Extreme events
can impact the reliability of such systems. Decentralized, and more
privacy-preserving systems, such as <a href="https://irma.app/">IRMA</a>
can help to build more reliable authentication infrastructures. With
IRMA, a user can store signed attributes, such as their full name or
address, within the IRMA mobile app. Subsequently, the user can disclose
a subset of her attributes to parties during an authentication session.
The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable
Credentials (VC)</a> standard helps to make such systems interoperable,
that is, users can use attributes across different credential systems.
With a proof of concept, we show how to make IRMA VC-compliant.</p>
<p>During extreme events, such as power outages or big floods,
centralized systems are especially vulnerable as their availability can
be impacted. This could result in that the whole system is unusable.
Therefore, it is beneficial to develop decentralized infrastructures, as
one is not dependent on centralized components.</p>
<p>Digital authentication nowadays is mostly done via centralized
systems, such as DigiD, the authentication system of governmental
services in the Netherlands. Every authentication session goes through a
central authority, which makes the system centralized. Additionally,
from a privacy-perspective, an issue is that such a system can keep
track on which sites users authenticate. To achieve more system
reliability and more user privacy, it is desirable to develop
authentication systems that are working in a more decentralized
manner.</p>
<p>One existing solution to this challenge is <a
href="https://irma.app/">IRMA</a>. IRMA stands for I Reveal My
Attributes and is developed by the Dutch non-profit organization <a
href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/">Privacy By Design</a>. A
central element of IRMA is a mobile app, which the foundation promotes
as a digital passport on your own mobile device. Users can collect
signed attributes, a set of attributes is called a credential, from
authoritative parties. An attribute is for instance, your Dutch BSN,
full name, or email address. IRMA protects the privacy of individuals by
letting the individuals decide which attributes they want to disclose to
whom, and by implementing advanced cryptography, including
zero-knowledge proof techniques. Consequently, the receiving party can
validate the authenticity of the disclosed credentials without the need
to contact the party that issued the credentials.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials
(VC)</a> is a standard developed by the W3C. It provides a data model
and a syntax aiming to make credential systems interoperable, for
instance, it can enable users to disclose credentials issued by one
system to another system.</p>
<p>Currently, IRMA can only be used within the IRMA ecosystem, that is,
among servers and mobile apps that use the IRMA attributes. However, it
would be desirable that people are able to use such advanced
technologies and authentic attributes on the entire web across different
systems. This avoids that people need different apps to be used, that
could contain the same attributes, with different systems. Our research
shows that it is possible to make IRMA VC-compliant via a proof of
concept. Subsequently, through VCs, IRMA attributes are available for
servers and apps outside the IRMA ecosystem. Similarly, other
credentials can become universally verifiable.</p>
<p>As decentralized systems become increasingly more available,
governments and other organizations can utilize reliable and privacy
protecting authentication widely. This benefits everyone – even and
especially during extreme events.</p>

<p>Go is often thought of as a server programming language, especially
one used for microservices. However, I argue that it can also be a good
language for much smaller systems: microcontrollers. Especially with the
Internet of Things there is a need for a language that is safer, easier
to use (harder to misuse) and easier to build and test.</p>
<p>For many years, C has been the dominant language in the embedded
world and especially microcontrollers. Almost all embedded systems are
written in C. The last few years this has been changing, with new
languages being used for this purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/what/embedded">Rust</a> has seen
rapid growth in embedded systems with its focus on safety and
expressiveness. It is in fact a great replacement for C, as it is just
as low level and efficient as C but without all the footguns. However,
many people find this language hard to learn.</li>
<li>Another language that's sometimes used is Python, in the form of <a
href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a>. This is in fact what
powers the SHA2017 and MCH2022 badges. While the project is an amazing
accomplishment, it still suffers from the fact that the language is
interpreted and there are limits to how fast it can be.</li>
<li>Some people have also used other languages, such as <a
href="https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/release/">Lua</a>, <a
href="https://www.espruino.com/">JavaScript</a>, <a
href="https://www.astrobe.com/">Oberon</a>, <a
href="https://hackaday.com/2017/01/27/forth-the-hackers-language/">Forth</a>,
<a href="https://blog.adacore.com/ada-on-the-microbit">Ada</a>, and
probably others. I'm not aware of a language that got much further than
experimental or very specific uses.</li>
<li>Then there is <a href="https://tinygo.org/">TinyGo</a>, which is a
new compiler for the Go language and primarily targets baremetal
embedded systems and WebAssembly. This is what I will talk about.</li>
</ul>
<p>TinyGo is a new compiler for the Go programming language. Its goal is
to implement the Go language specification, be able to compile most of
the Go standard library, but still optimize well enough so that binaries
can run on a range of large and small embedded systems. It optimizes
much more aggressively than the main Go implementation and the resulting
binaries are able to run on systems ranging from the Arduino Uno, to the
BBC micro:bit, to the MCH2022 badge with an ESP32 chip. I believe TinyGo
offers most of the ease-of-use benefits of interpreted languages while
providing most of the performance benefits of languages such as C.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will cover what kinds of problems C can cause, why Go
can be a great fit on embedded systems, an explanation of some
optimizations that it does that help lower its code size and RAM
consumption, and some examples of projects written using TinyGo. Oh, and
of course some demos.</p>

<p>Payment Service Directive (PSD2) is a fairly recent directive in
Europe when it comes to electronic payments. For most of us this has
happened invisibly. Although this new directive creates a lot of
opportunities for fintech companies it also puts the privacy of tenths
of millions of people in the hands of private companies. This talk will
discuss the opportunities this will provide within Europe both for
Fintech's… and scammers.</p>
<p>In 2020 the Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) has become the
directive governing banking in Europe. This means that for financial
transactions between businesses, persons and banks a new European-wide
payment system is available. While before PSD2 in order to be able to
act as a Payment Service Provider (PSP) you needed to be certified by
the local central bank, now with PSD2 this is no longer necessary. This
means all transaction data for an IBAN number going back up to years can
be queried by commercial parties investing a few hundred euro’s. An
example will be shown how easy it is to overlook giving consent for this

<p>How should we live together? How do we make a complex,
interdependent, infrastructural society less exploitive? In this talk,
we'll try to frame questions, if not answers, grounded in the context of
the political changes required to mitigate and survive climate change,
global fascism, and hypercapitalism.</p>
<p>This talk starts from two threads. First, the common understanding of
"freedom" derives from the institution of slavery. Looking at alternate
definitions provides the foundation for rethinking the building blocks
of society and human interaction. Second, climate change represents an
immediate existential threat to human civilization, but mitigating it is
no longer a question of technology — only of collective will.</p>
<p>If we insist on maintaining existing structures of ownership and
inequality, we significantly reduce our chance of survival. However,
these questions of freedom, ownership, and equity aren't just political
questions, they're directly encoded in the infrastructure we all rely on
to survive — that same infrastructure that we currently need to replace,
almost wholesale.</p>
<p>In reality, any path to survival will imply a muddle of adaptation,
mitigation, replacement, and elimination, both of infrastructural
components and of elements of the social contract and its governance
systems. Harm reduction is more important and more probable than
ideologically perfect revolutions (or even evolutions). However,
plausible visions of the future are a critical ingredient for the hope
we need to continue the work, and will also directly shape that
work.</p>
<p>Most folks who live in ownership societies (almost everyone, now)
find the idea of moving away from an ownership model terrifying, because
it means giving up those things that give them a sense of security.
Understanding the emotional interiority of life in a post-ownership
society can change that, and understanding the dynamics of different
freedoms can help us understand how we might get there.</p>
<p>As people who build infrastructure, we can play with the social
models our infrastructure encodes — and have been doing so for decades.
Likewise, we can (and have been) rebuilding pieces of the social
contracts that shape our personal lives. This talk aims to leave you
with new questions and new directions for that work.</p>

<p>I want a Web where CDNs are unnecessary.</p>
<p>Where different organizations, different website operators, can help
each other out by hosting assets for each others' websites, thus
spreading the load across many orgs in solidarity, instead of
centralizing it in gatekeepers.</p>
<p>I believe I might slowly be getting to a point of having a decent
answer to that question. No blockchain required.</p>
<p>What if I told you the <a
href="https://gitlab.com/rysiekpl/libresilient/">code for this is
already mostly there</a>?</p>
<p>All major browsers support Service Workers and Subresource Integrity,
which means we can have a piece of JS that: 1. only gets updated from
the original domain 2. handles all requests for the website 3. routes
these requests to the original domain, or hits third party endpoints
when the original domain is unavailable for whatever reason 4. has ways
of distributing and checking Subresource Integrity on any fetched
resource.</p>
<p>And we do!</p>
<p>Points 1. and 2. are assured by Service Workers API, so browsers
enforce that.</p>
<p>Point 3. can be achieved with <a
href="https://gitlab.com/rysiekpl/libresilient/-/blob/master/plugins/alt-fetch.js">LibResilient's
the alt-fetch plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Point 4. is the job of <a
href="https://gitlab.com/rysiekpl/libresilient/-/blob/master/plugins/signed-integrity.js">LibResilient's
signed-integrity plugin</a>.</p>
<p>This is all very PoC. Documentation is lacking or non-existent. But
it's already there, ready to be tested and improved.</p>

line of JavaScript - <strong>NOT</strong> care about Erlang or it's
Syntax - <strong>NOT</strong> spend hours to making the application
WebSocket-capable and feel "live"</p>
<p>But we will - write a state-of-the-art application that looks and
feels professional in record time - have tests for every feature,
buttons, links or forms we implement (test-coverage upwards of 90%) -
have formatted our code, linted, error checked - run the test-suite,

<p>Enterprise web applications have been deployed rapidly to the
internet over the last ten years. Often, these applications remain
secure, purely due to how difficult it is getting a copy of the source
code. Unsurprisingly, some of the most popular enterprise web
applications contain critical pre-authentication vulnerabilities. This
presentation discusses how to get your hands on enterprise web
applications and how to audit them for vulnerabilities, demonstrated
through the disclosure of multiple 0days in popular enterprise web
applications.</p>
<p>When performing offensive source code analysis, the road to critical
pre-authentication vulnerabilities usually involves a treacherous
journey. From obtaining the source code, to mapping out sources and
sinks, this presentation will take you on this journey to finding
critical bugs in the following software:</p>
<ul>
<li>IBM Websphere Portal / HCL Digital Experiences</li>
<li>Solarwinds Web Help Desk</li>
<li>Sitecore Experience Platform</li>
<li>VMWare Workspace One UEM (AirWatch)</li>
</ul>
<p>By experiencing the discovery process of 0days in popular enterprise
web applications, this process can be repeated on the enterprise
applications your company uses. The vulnerabilities discussed in this
presentation have all gone through a responsible disclosure process.</p>

<p>Public viewing of the 4 part Videoland series "ze weten alles van je"
This movie is about the disappearance of Arjen Kamphuis. Arjen was part
of orga of several early dutch hackercamps and regularly spoke at such
events. It's safe to say he is "one of us"</p>
<p>Almost four years ago, August 2018, the Dutch Cybersecurity expert
Arjen Kamphuis disappeared while being on holiday in Norway. His
disappearance is still veiled in mysteries. His kayak was found in a
fjord near Bodø, but some days later his cellphone connected to a
network deep in the south of Norway. Someone with his opsec and a his
healthy distrust of governments and other authorities would have secured
his mobile devices, so this ping must have been Kamphuis himself. Or so
it was believed..</p>
<p>The Videoland series with the grim title "Ze Weten Alles van Je"
chose to go with a interesting mix of fiction and non fiction; part
documentary, part acting. Friends of Arjen get interviewed by an actress
playing an investigative journalist who also travels to Norway in search
for answers. During her search she interviews several people who were
involved in the actual missing persons case. This story line is
intertwined with some fiction and made up characters.</p>

<p>A laser harp is a magic musical instrument that makes sounds from
light beams. Ever since Jean-Michel Jarre used a laser harp in his live
concerts to play Rendez Vous 2, many people have dreamt to play one. But
they are ridiculously expensive! Klaas van Gend will discuss his ongoing
journey with Pascal Ahout to design a cheap and simple laser harp
suitable for a local percussionist group. A revolutionary simple laser
harp, using only an Arduino board, and no moving parts. Hopefully, at
the time this talk happens, the design is ready to be demoed, so we’ll
end with a live demo or a video recording showcasing our working laser
harp.</p>
<p>The director from St. Caecilia percussionists group
Lieshout-Mariahout in Brabant always wants to go beyond just playing
music. He loves to bring in nonstandard instruments, video or lighting
tricks. For an upcoming show, he wants to compose a new piece with a
laser harp. As usual, he came to his audio and lighting engineer Pascal
Ahout, who asked software engineer Klaas van Gend to join in. Together,
they started designing a reliable laser harp from scratch, reviewing
various sources on the internet and revisiting all design decisions.
Their laser harp design looks remarkably different – no moving parts, no
complex optics and cheap! This talk will show the design process,
implementation details and hopefully the results. Indeed: the
development is not done yet. So we may end the talk explaining why our

<p>Based on the world´s first, and as far as we know still the only
accurate double entry bookkeeping based simulation of the banking
system, we will talk through how fractional reserve banking really works
from a network perspective, and how it has influenced both economic
activity and economic theory in many unappreciated ways.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to predict what the central banks will do
next, and how to make sensible financial decisions despite this, this is
the talk to you. Inflation is back, and it´s still the same. We´ll also
talk about ways to contribute to the development of economic models and
simulations that are based on real economies, and not on a 30 year
practice of fitting a very short mathematical ruler, to a very long
curve.</p>
<p>It all started innocently enough, with an attempt to build a simple
banking simulation in python of the standard Economics 101 textbook
description of the banking system. This failed to work as soon as loan
repayments were put in. The next version was a little more complicated,
agent based, and used double entry book keeping, and the version after
that added some simple economic features like widget producers and
households (which actually makes it as sophisticated as "sophisticated
economic models" (it´s still nowhere complete though), and has been used
to enlighten/confuse several classes of computer science students at
Reykjavik University in Iceland.</p>
<p>Along the way we learnt how money gets created and destroyed, how
several different kinds of bank regulation actually worked, identified
several positive feedback loops in the financial system, how
international money transfers don´t actually transfer money, and why it
was probably inevitable cryptocurrency would re-invent fractional
reserve banking right after they reinvented its book keeping.</p>

<p>This talk will investigate how the concept of private property has
fundamentally altered our behavior towards the environment. We will
investigate how an alternative ontology of electronic waste is needed
and argue why dumpster diving, hacking and reverse engineering abandoned
electronics is more relevant than ever to tackle this problem.</p>
<p>Within the discourse that surrounds the global rise in electronic
waste, only a select range of subjects receive attention from the public
- international relations, global waste management strategies and
corporate greenwashing rhetoric that emphasizes a ‘circular’ economy.
Although the legitimacy of these strategies can be debated, they fail to
address the root of the problem. Following the pervasive concept of
private property and how it has infiltrated the ways in which we think
about ourselves, our relationships between each other and the
environment, we will arrive at how this concept has solidified itself
within the ontological frameworks we use to make sense of waste and
electronic waste in particular. We will discuss how, when we get rid of
the concept of private property (and subsequently the concept of waste),
we can reimagine what abandoned electronics mean to us and how we can
best address the incessant pressure from manufacturers to treat them as
expendable, throw-away objects. We will discuss how collective dumpster
diving, hacking and reverse engineering abandoned electronics might be a
possible solution and present free and open source tools that could aid
us in the process.</p>

<p>Microbes are everywhere. They are part of nature, both around us and
inside of us. When you provide their desired niche, you can make them do
something for you, in a mutually beneficial arrangement. This talk will
take you into their realm, and show a few practical examples and hacking
opportunities.</p>
<p>Our climate is on fire, but we are still reaching for an Ultimate
Solution. We don't move until we get a drop-in replacement to sustain
current habits, at no extra cost. Our cognitive dissonance makes us
trust politicians to deliver on promises, and energy vendors to
withstand lucrative green washing. But it is both interesting and
profitable to be part of the solution, and not of the problem.</p>
<p>I have a long-standing fascination with microbial processes. They are
adaptive and resilient while they modestly take on chores that pull
things back to nature's standards. I think many problems that we are
facing now can be solved locally and efficiently with clever
combinations of technology and microbiology. Not always complete
solutions and not everything is simple, but they certainly add to
resilience and taking ownership of problem <em>and</em> solution.</p>
<p>In a perfect situation, energy is harvested when&amp;where it is
abundant and moved to when&amp;where it is needed. This talk
demonstrates ways of doing at least some of that with the help of
microbial systems. We will demonstrate overlap and connections, and
conditions under which they may be hacked:</p>
<p>Outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beer. Vinegar. Innoculation. Permaculture.</li>
<li>Gut. Fiber or Fat. SCFA. Immune system. Epigenetics.</li>
<li>Biogas. Acetate. Sulphur and ammonia. Garbage in, garbage out.</li>
<li>Microbial fuel cell. Clay and carbon. Training.</li>
<li>Pee. Urea. Energy calculations for a Raspberry Pee.</li>
<li>Poo. Phosphate. Energy calculations for iPoo mobility.</li>
<li>Compost. Worms. Energy calculations for heat generation.</li>
<li>Climate change &amp; zoonose. Cramming sick animals. Antibiotics.
Government ignorance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making beer uses yeast to turn sugar to alcohol. Yeast can flexibly
adapt from/to glucose via DNA switching to generate different enzymes.
Let fruit flies in, and they bring along Acetobacter that reduce alcohol
to vinegar. Wild fermentation is more natural, and yields a lambic beer.
Save work by going for stable, naturally mixed processes.</li>
<li>Our gut processes whatever we can't. Two rough kinds of colonies
co-exist. One consumes cholesterol/bile and the other plants/fiber. They
tune our body via SCFA, the immune system and epigenetics. You can hack
by changing your food (and after a few weeks, the microbes are thought
to hack you by asking for more; so much for free will?!?)</li>
<li>Biogas works like a gut. It forms/consumes acetate CH₃COOH to
produce CO₂ and methane CH₄ with byproducts hydrogen H₂, hydrosulphide
H₂S and ammonia NH₃. Local cycles can process known sludge and produce
usable liquid output, but large-scale anonymity destroys that. Some
influences are possible, but the process is basically difficult, smelly
and a bit dangerous.</li>
<li>Microbes can live in a fuel cell, which then accepts electrons and
passes H+ through a membrane. Urine can be broken down with just clay
and carbon – and a culture. What are researchers doing? A variant to
produce hydrogen H₂. And the potential of driving microbes by passing in
a current.</li>
<li>Pee contains urea (NH₂)CO(NH₂), a hydrogen carrier. Urea is stable
when dried, but otherwise reduces to ammonia NH₃. Soil microbes normally
turn ammonia into atmospheric N₂ and water. But we can also use urea in
a fuel cell to extract electricity or hydrogen.</li>
<li>Poo contains many microbes, some of which are pathogenic. But it is
also our disposal channel for phosphorous (which we mine to grow food)
and nitrogen. Troubled hygiene, but can this be safe? Is it a good
idea?</li>
<li>Compost is incredibly straightforward and safe. The nutrient cycle
is so short that nature could have invented it… oh wait, it did. Spring
brings a gradual start, Summer collects energy, Autumn sheds it off and
Winter benefits from the captured energy. Because composting generates
heat, and has been used for heating homes, or parts of homes. Though
mostly self-controlled, there are broad requirements for heat retention,
moisture, oxygenation and C:N ratio. Working with these, you can have
some degree of control over this process.</li>
<li>Microbes mutate if we force them into another environment. Like a
sick animal. Or 3000 of them. Antibiotics form a bonus challenge. Many
animal farmers carry resistent microbes. Zoonoses are on the rise due to
climate change, and they are the common source of infectious diseases.

<p>Digital maps are ubiquitous tools in our everyday life. In the early
90s, the idea of browsing the world digitally and visiting any place was
groundbreaking. The first solution to this problem is known as
"TerraVision", which was breathtaking at that time. Today, the idea of
exploring your surroundings using digital maps has become pretty
normal.</p>
<p>But how do these maps work? In this talk, I want to provide an
overview of the foundations of digital mapping solutions. Differences
between maps which use vector data and rasterized satellite imaginary
will be outlined. Furthermore, a new and open-source map renderer called
<a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs">maplibre-rs</a> will
be presented, which is created using Rust and modern web technologies
like WebWorkers and WebAssembly. Lastly, I want to show differences
between commercial solutions and free and open-source ones.</p>
<p>A lot of mobile and web applications depend on customizing and
displaying maps. There are not many cross-platform solutions available.
Some only work in the web. Some only work on mobile devices.
Furthermore, there are only a few truly free and open-source mapping
stacks available. I want to explain how <a
href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs">maplibre-rs</a> can solve
current challenges by leveraging a modern rendering stack.</p>
<p>Last year I had a lot of spare time and decided to kick-start a
project which combines different areas of interest: Rust, 3D rendering,
Geo data This project was adopted recently by the <a
href="https://maplibre.org/">MapLibre</a> project and is now known as <a
href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs">maplibre-rs</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs">maplibre-rs</a>
library is a proof of concept which showed me the complexity of mapping
solutions. It takes a lot of steps until edits from OpenStreetMap
contributors are finally rendered in consumer applications. With this
task I want to take listeners on a journey from drawing changes in the
OpenStreetMap editor all the way until vectors are uploaded to from
memory to GPUs.</p>
<p>Like outlined in the abstract, I want to cover multiple topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foundations of digital maps (How to determine which data should be
loaded? What are vector and raster tiles?)</li>
<li>Show the technology stack which allows us to design and develop a
cross-platform map renderer (Web, Mobile, Desktop)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, I want to provide a software developer perspective on mapping
technologies.</p>

does advertising work on mobile? Can your device be fingerprinted? What
kind of privacy threats exists on Android? We will learn about the

<p>The Gigatron is a microcomputer without a microprocessor. It was made
into a DIY electronics kit and sold over 1000 pieces from 2018 to 2020.
It is now open source. In this talk, I will not go into the working of
the kit, but explain what you need to think about when creating a kit
and keeping it manageable. Think of what to design, sourcing components,
testing, preventing too many support calls and more.</p>
<p>The Gigatron is a microcomputer without a microprocessor. During the
design phase, a decision was made to maybe make it into a Do-It-Yourself
electronics kit. Many design decisions have been influenced by that
decision, as creating a unique prototype is a lot different from
creating a succesful kit.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will go over some of these design decisions. I think
the majority of them worked out very well, as over 1000 kits were sold
between 2018 and 2020, before the Gigatron becoming open source. These
design decisions were influenced by other kit builders, who had already
gone through that process, like the people behind the PiDP-8 and
Enigma-E.</p>
<p>I would like to share some of that knowledge, so you can also stand
on the shoulders of the giants before me. And of course to also
stimulate the attendees to make their hobby project into a kit.</p>
<p>No previous knowledge is needed. The talk is aimed at people wanting

<p>Systems created by humans may – no <em>will</em> – contain flaws. In
order to shine a light on these flaws, you can use a technique called
threat modelling. We will take a look at different threat modelling
methods that empower hackers (and others) to study the architecture of a
system.</p>
<p>There are hundreds if not thousands of different threat modelling
methods that can be used to tease apart the structure of a system in the
search for security issues. In this workshop, we will cover the key
principles behind these methods and we will provide prototypical worked
examples. In order to give you hands-on experience with threat
modelling, we will go through an archetypical threat modelling exercise
together. We will close the workshop by having you apply these methods
to one of your own systems. You will be provided with relevant
background material to allow you to integrate threat modelling into your
daily activities going forward.</p>

<p>Want to get your hands dirty with Asterisk? Want to learn about how
VoIP works? Then this is the workshop for you. In this workshop, you
will learn how VoIP works and how you can quickly get started with the
popular phone system Asterisk. Before you know it, you will be making
and receiving calls and have a starting point for further tinkering.</p>
<p>Asterisk is the 'swiss army knife' of Telephony. But getting started
can be pretty daunting. So many config files, so much documentation, so
little time…</p>
<p>In this workshop you will get a grasp on the basics of VoIP protocols
and how you can configure Asterisk to quickly get up and running. Before
you know it, you will be making and receiving calls with your own
Asterisk phone system. After that, the possibilities are endless: start
sending/receiving faxes, harass telemarketers or create hidden
menus.</p>
<p>To participate in the workshop part, you will need some sort of VoIP
phone. This can be hardware, but a VoIP phone on your PC will be more
practical (a so-called 'softphone'). Recommendations for this are
MicroSIP on Windows, Telephone on macOS or LinPhone on Linux
distros.</p>
<p>You will be provided with a trunk account, phone number and Debian
VPS with root access. Keep in mind that these will become inactive one

<p>At the Workshop we will be modelling Menstrual Cup moulds with
[Openscad] (https://openscad.org/). Our plan is to be the first to use
resin 3d printer's to make menstrual cup moulds and build an injection
moulding machine, to create a decentralised network of medium scale
menstrual cup makers.</p>
<p>We at The Crimson Wave Project are working on creating open-source
Menstrual Cups that are customisable. Using Resin 3d printing and
injection moulding. Our goal is to address period poverty, which is the
lack of access to sanitary products due to financial constraints. 3 in
10 menstruators in the UK struggle with period poverty. Sustainable
reusable products such as menstrual cups are better for the environment
and cheaper in the long-term. (If you are based in the Netherlands or
near by and have access to a CNC please contact me)</p>

<p>Many parsing tools and generators have been developed starting from a
certain parsing algorithm. In the past twenty years, I have worked on a
parser tool with a focus on usability and being intuitive. Not
necessarily producing the most efficient parser, but one that is fast
enough for practical purposes. The workshop will start with the most
elementary aspects of parsing from examples and gradually explain all
the complexities of writing grammars and explain the solutions to
them.</p>
<p>The workshop will start with some simple examples of parsing,
starting with arithmetic expressions. An online interactive parser will
be used to explain various examples and allow participants to experiment
themselves. Next the workshop will explain a practical and intuitive
approach to specifying grammars. In a number of small steps, the various
aspects will be explained. Subjects like operator priorities and dealing
with ambiguity will be addressed. Also the build-in method for
constructing an abstract syntax tree will be explained. At the end the
participants should be able to write a grammar for a small programming
language and even implement an interpreter for it based on one that is
provided. If there is room to dive into the more technical aspects of
the parser, I can delve into the various implementations in C, C++ and
JavaScript.</p>
<p>I would very much like to give this as an interactive workshop,
starting with the most simple question: What is 3 + 4? The materials for
this workshop will can be found at

<p>Do we want social media platforms that provide neutral platform for
pluralistic debate, or do we want social media platforms that protect
their users from abuse and de-platform abusers? Can we have both? Is
moderation censorship? Is Signal social media?</p>
<p>The debate about how to deal with abusers and fascists on social
media has been simmering for a long while, but really blew up after the
siege of the US Capitol. It has become clear, finally, that <a
href="https://redecentralize.org/blog/2021/01/18/centralization-is-a-danger-to-democracy.html">something
needs to be done</a>. What remains unclear is… what?</p>
<p>This workshop will probably not offer answers, but will at least try
to make sense of that debate. A debate which is tangled and twisted, and
complicated by the fact that for some (like journalists) social media is
the infrastructure they need to do their work and reach their audience,
while for others (like activists) it's the service they use to
communicate among themselves.</p>
<p>Combine this with how strong the incentives are for centralized
social media monopolies to not "police content" (lest they be accused of
censorship), and how their algorithms tend to promote most-clickable
(and therefore often extremist) content, and you find yourself in a
discussion where journalists defend Nazis' access to Facebook.</p>
<p>There is plenty to unwrap there, so let's sit down and try to do just
that together. Things that seem important (of course we will not limit
our discussion to only these!) would be:</p>
<h2 id="is-social-media-infrastructure-or-service">Is social media
infrastructure, or service?</h2>
<p>If it's infrastructure, we want it to be neutral (just like we want
our ISPs not to police our bits on the wire). If it's a service, perhaps
we want some moderation to happen?</p>
<p>Perhaps it needs to be both &amp;ndash; <a
href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech">a
neutral infrastructure on which opinionated services can be built</a>?
This would immediately simplify this conversation, making it clear where
moderation belongs, and where it doesn't.</p>
<h2 id="giving-platform-vs.-providing-tools">Giving platform
vs. providing tools</h2>
<p>There is a difference between giving platform and just providing
communication tools. It is hard to argue Facebook not banning a prolific
fascist does provide them with a platform. It is as hard to argue that
Signal doing same does not.</p>
<p>This difference seems to disappear in a lot of discussions; for
example, when some propose that mainstream social media should ban
fascists, others claim that it doesn't matter since they will still be
able to communicate on Gab or Parler.</p>
<p>However, neither Gab nor Parler has the reach of mainstream social
media. Effectively, this leaves their users stewing in their own sauce,
not able to radicalize anyone new. They can still communicate and
organize, but adding new members comes with added friction. So, how
important is that friction? How much difference does it make?</p>
<h2 id="public-vs.-private-channels-of-communication">Public vs. private
channels of communication</h2>
<p>A public Twitter profile with 50k followers is clearly a public
channel. A Signal group of 10 people is clearly a private channel.
Should a 50k-member Signal group considered private or public?</p>
<p>This question is relevant in the context of platform vs. tools
distinction above. It's another way of asking: what is, really, the
difference between a platform and an internal communication tool?</p>
<p>Signal has already added several "social" features (message
reactions, and being able to join groups by clicking a link). Is keeping
the groups invite-only on an encrypted platform enough for them to not
be considered a "public" channel? If not, should Signal start moderating
groups?..</p>
<p>What about closed Facebook groups &amp;ndash; can these be considered
private channels? If so, can they be ignored by Facebook moderators?</p>

<p>Hacking = playing. Let me take you along in this playshop to discover
and experience the power of a playful mind and the science behind it. In
this Playshop we will Play ourselves a way through a lot of the
scientific proof about the positive effects of embedding it in your day
to day life. Playful people are more creative, have more fun and are
overall more happy and joyful. Come to this session and unlearn this
stupid idea that playing is for children!</p>
<p>Playing is proven to be crucial for learning, innovating and
mentoring. And thus a fundamental tool for any hacker or maker out
there. I rediscovered playing, made my job out of it and I would love to
take you on a journey with an inspirational, interactive and pragmatic
session to do so too (or even more)</p>
<p>There was a time in your life where you stopped playing. Or you
probably didn’t. What’s up with the idea that playing is childish? Why
do we ignore all the great scientific proof that playing is the best way
to learn? This is a personal story about finding out what I need to do,
combined with evidence based knowledge.</p>
<p>The take aways of this playshop are: – 7 most important scientific
reasons why you should encourage playing in a professional setting. –
The difference between playing and gaming. – 3 tips to start tomorrow. –
A shitload of games which we will play and you can use yourself 🙂 (I
even have a CYBER! Game!)</p>

<p>Scratch is a awesome language and tool to get started with
programming in a playful and creative way. This workshop is intended for
complete beginners as well as those who already have some experience
with Scratch.</p>
<p>Not able to attend the workshop? Follow the steps on the field or at
home: https://scratch.cmptr.nl</p>
<hr />
<p>Scratch is een geweldige taal en een programma om aan de slag te gaan
met programmeren door een beetje creatief te klooien. Deze workshop is
bedoeld voor zowel beginners als mensen die al wat ervaring met Scratch
hebben.</p>
<p>Kan je er niet bij zijn? Je kan de stappen ook op het veld of wanneer
je terug thuis bent volgen: https://scratch.cmptr.nl</p>
<p>You'll learn the basics by creating an example game. After that, use
your creativity and problem solving skills to make the game unique with
your own rules and graphics. Ask around for help or to get advice on how
to add a next challenge.</p>
<p>If you already have some experience with Scratch, you can also learn
how to create beautifully colored fractal curves. In a few steps, you'll
create Scratch code that will use itself (recursion) to draw a pattern
that has the same properties, no matter how much you zoom in.</p>
<h5 id="practical-information-1">Practical information</h5>
<ul>
<li>The workshop will be a mix of English and Dutch, and you can read a
bit in both languages. Händen und Füßen will be used if necessary.</li>
<li>You need to bring your own computer or tablet that connects to the
internet. Don't forget to charge the battery and bring someone to help
you with carrying and using it if necessary.</li>
<li>You can use Scratch with almost any computer or tablet that runs an
internet browser. Try: https://scratch.mit.edu/create. Bigger, brighter,
upright screens work best.</li>
<li>Scratch was designed for ages 8 and up. It could be good to bring
someone to help you out. Solving programming challenges together can be
a lot of fun.</li>
<li>You can do the workshop at home as well, via
https://scratch.cmptr.nl</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nederlands-1">Nederlands</h3>
<p>Leer de basis door een voorbeeldspelletje te maken. Gebruik daarna je
creativiteit en vindingrijkheid om je spel uniek te maken met eigen
regels, afbeeldingen en animaties. Vraag rond voor hulp of om advies te
krijgen om een volgende uitdaging aan je spel toe te voegen.</p>
<p>Als je al wat ervaring met Scratch hebt kan je ook leren hoe je
prachtig gekleurde fractals kan maken. In een paar stappen maak je
Scratch-code die zichzelf gebruikt (recursie) om een patroon te tekenen
die steeds dezelfde eigenschappen heeft, hoe ver je ook inzoomt.</p>
<h5 id="praktische-informatie-1">Praktische informatie</h5>
<ul>
<li>De workshop zal een mix van Engels en Nederlands zijn, en je kan
iets lezen in beide talen.</li>
<li>Neem je eigen computer of tablet met internetverbinding mee. Vergeet
'm niet op te laden, en neem iemand mee die je helpt met dragen en
gebruiken als dat nodig is.</li>
<li>Scratch werkt op bijna elke computer of tablet met een
internetbrowser. Probeer: https://scratch.mit.edu/create. Grotere,
heldere schermen die rechtop staan werken het beste.</li>
<li>Scratch is ontworpen voor 8 jaar en ouder. Het kan helpen om iemand
mee te nemen om je te assisteren. Samen programmeeruitdagingen oplossen
kan erg leuk zijn.</li>
<li>De workshop is ook thuis te volgen via https://scratch.cmptr.nl</li>

<p>Participants will learn the complete workflow of creating a circuit
board with KiCad. At the end of the workshop, you will have a designed
PCB that blinks some LEDs and is ready for manufacturing. No prior
experience is required, basic electronics knowledge is useful.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: You need to bring a Notebook with KiCad
6.x including the symbol- and footprint libraries installed. It does not
matter which OS. If possible, bring a mouse with a scroll-wheel.</p>
<p>The workshop will have a 10-15minutes lecture part in the beginning
where the whole process is demonstrated. You won't need to take notes, a
cheat-sheet with the process-steps and the most important shortcuts will
be provided. After the introduction you will draw a simple circuit that
blinks two LEDs. Create the layout for it and export manufacturing data.
Experienced KiCad users will be around the whole time to answer
questions and</p>
<p>People who know KiCad already are welcome as well. For discussion as
well as additional help.</p>
<p>You can get KiCad at https://www.kicad.org/ (<strong>don't'</strong>
use kicad-pcb.org). Most linux distributions will also have a packaged
version, make sure to also install the symbol and footprint
libraries.</p>

<p>In this workshop, we will learn how to assemble tiny parts on circuit
boards by building an electronic touch-activated purring kitten. Anyone
can do it. Yes, even you who never touched anything electronic before.
Takes 120mins, 20€/kit, avoid caffeine immediately before. Max 10
participants per session, sign up on PAPER at the Hardware Hacking
Area.</p>
<p>Takes about two hours. Basic workshop. No prior knowledge needed.
Materials cost 20€ per kit.</p>
<p>We are going to build an electronic kitten using tiny tiny SMD parts.
It will purr when you touch it right and hiss when you touch it wrong.
It's going to work. You will learn how to make your hands not shake at
all ever. You will learn how to activate your builtin precision
positioning superpowers.</p>
<p>For people afraid of surface mount assembly/rework. You know those
tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible
and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you
how!</p>
<p>Think you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s?
Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is
minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to
THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no
longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the
workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The workshop kit costs 20€. Please SIGN UP ON THE PAPER LIST at the
Hardware Hacking Area. PLEASE BE ON TIME!</p>

<p>Using a DIY conductive dough/clay you will create your own creatures
and adorn them with working (basic) electronics like LED's and buzzers.
Always wanted to create a snail with blinking lights? Or a lovely heart
with lights? This is your chance! This workshop is aimed at kids (4 -
10yrs) Supervision of an adult is required. The dough uses food coloring
and is made using basic food ingredients. Food allergies? Check the
recipe in our repository before taking part!</p>
<p>Using nothing but basic kitchen ingredients (flour, salt, lemon
juice, vegetable oil) we will create a conductive dough (clay) in
different colors (using food coloring). Combined with a battery pack
(6Volts) the dough is conductive enough due to the salt and lemon juice
(and therefor also not edible) to power LED's and a simple buzzer.</p>
<p>You will be able to sculpt your own creations. Add basic electronics
like LED's and buzzers and make them come alive! This workshop is aimed
at kids (4 - 10yrs) Supervision of an adult is required. Food allergies?

<p>If you have young kids, you might not want them playing Minecraft on
public servers with strangers. This talk describes my experience in
running my own Minecraft server for my kids and their friends, using
different clients (Minecraft Bedrock on tablet and Minecraft Java on
desktop) and how to give every player a "safe space" where others cannot
blow up the creations you've spend days on creating them. The target
audience of this talk is not the kids playing, but the parents that try
to run the Minecraft server.</p>
<p>How hard can it be to run a Minecraft server? Turns out it is a lot
like hacking in the 90's where you find obscure tutorials at forums that
tell you to install random software and push random buttons. This talk
presents my lessons learned from running a Minecraft server for my kids
and their friends. We'll deal with different software for running a
Minecraft server, the hardware selection, how to deal with bedrock
clients, how to implement proper backups, how to ensure that creations
are not destroyed, how to allow kids to easily switch between survival
and creative mode without making them operators.</p>

<p>Yes, we have been using social media to connect for a long time now,
but 2020 made us dependent on them more than ever. It's time we have an
open dialogue. Burst our individual filter bubbles and communicate what
our individual experience of social media feels like. In this session,
we will come together, interact, go through a bunch of skillfully
crafted activities and draw conclusions on what's the real state of our
virtual lives? Which humane components are lacking? What extra aspects
have been added? How is it affecting our bonding, privacy,
individuality, organization, and dialogue?</p>
<p>This session aims to identify and learn about several unrealistic
aspects that have entered our lives knowingly/unknowingly through
prominent social media. The session will be split into multiple modules
and worksheets which will enable us to dive into discussions like what
brings us to social media, what our interaction feels like, what
economic principles govern the design of social media, what are the
challenges and socio-cultural complexities that have been introduced in
present day social media. We will do a quick mix and match of popular
opinions about social media amongst the group and perform thoughtful
analysis of how we engage with these platforms by mapping the tech into
real-life space-time. Thereby identifying the gaps and ineffectual
features of social media focusing on how social media affects our
bonding, individuality, organisation and dialogue.</p>
<p>Channeling in our creative spirits, we'd attempt to redesign the
interface that can connect people across the globe in a more human
manner.</p>
<p>Prerequisite: Attendees need to have at least one active social media
account (LinkedIn/Twitter/Facebook/Instagram etc) and bring along their
mobile phones with internet connectivity :)</p>

<p>With his alter ego Lola Lasagna, Galema also plays an important role
in that nightlife. His transformation as a drag queen - the first
fictional character that he really brought to life - is for him an
essential part of telling a story. Keep your eyes open for Lola!</p>
<p>Jurjen Galema recently graduated from the Frank Mohr Institute in
Groningen with an MA in Fine Art and Design and is a part-time drag
queen. Growing up in a village in Friesland meant the art world once
seemed remote. He aims to build a bridge through his soft sculptures by
creating worlds populated by strange figures with intriguing stories.
Gender, identity, kitsch, popular culture and obsessions are some of the
themes he investigates and interprets in his own unique way.</p>

<p>We are not machines. We need to look after ourselves and each other
in order to better look after each other and achieve what we want to
achieve. Also, keeping the population subdued through stress,
loneliness, sickness and anxiety is a feature of late-stage
capitalism.</p>
<p>Regenerative culture is about relationships. Our relationships with
ourselves and personal histories, our relationships with what we
struggle against, our relationships with other individuals day to day,
and our relationships as a group – these are completely interdependent.
Self care is also about taking care of the animal parts of the self that
respond instinctively to stressful situations with fight or flight or
faint.<br />
A regenerative human culture is healthy, resilient and adaptable; it
cares for the planet and it cares for life in the awareness that this is
the most effective way to create a thriving future for all of humanity.
Regenerative culture means improvements year on year, taking small steps
to heal and improve, and on all levels, including individuals and
communities. More than being a network of “activists”, we seek to find
ways of being and doing that support positive change.</p>

<p>This workshop will be held in our workshop tents located on Backbone
Boulevard between Liskov field and Flower field.</p>
<p>We'll set up a stream-based Python app to monitor new vulnerabilities
by using NLP (Natural Language Processing) in realtime. We'll be
experimenting with some basic NLP using spaCy to monitor when
vulnerabilities may go trending. Using Faust (stream processing) we'll
monitor RSS feeds, tweets and the NVD database and extract important
keywords using basic Natural Language Processing.</p>
<p>We'll be experimenting with some basic NLP to monitor when

monitor RSS feeds, tweets and the NVD database and extract important
keywords using basic Natural Language Processing. The results will be
saved in ElasticSearch where you'll be able to create fancy graphs about
what's currently trending!</p>
<p>Virtual machines running most of the components will be made
available. The VMs will run: - Kafka (Zookeeperless) - ElasticSearch -
Kibana - Postgres - Miniflux</p>
<p>(Basic) Python knowledge will be required for debugging. The
sourcecode is ready-as is so we'll only have to install dependencies and
start running :) Some bonus content may include (if time allows) the
same stack to monitor for phishing campaigns by monitoring certificate
transparency</p>
<p>PS. Will be to facilitate about 6 people. I'll be able to organise
multiple sessions if there is more interest :)</p>
<p>Materials used: -
https://github.com/d3vzer0/mch2022-workshop-streaming (primary Faust
sourcecode to watch twitter/rss/nvd database and save results to
ElasticSearch) - https://github.com/d3vzer0/mch2022-workshop-nlp (the

presentation will be full of case studies and exercises such as
geolocating ISIS supporters from Twitter and identifying neo-nazi
criminals in the US.</p>
<p>Bellingcat has conducted open source investigations into the downing
of MH17, syrian chemical attacks, high level poisonings, corruption
investigations, ecological research, war monitoring and etc. So what is
open source investigations, how can you do it and what challenges come

<p>As of today, most discussions on cyber security focus on privacy and
the implications of incidents involving data. However, those of us in
cyber physical security often see things differently as we study actors
attempting to use computers to impact the physical world (e.g. critical
infrastructure and industrial controls). Geopolitical conflicts and
accessible offensive security tools make defending against these threats
increasingly complex. The anthology I bring for you illustrates the
evolution of cyber physical threats through several stories with topics
that span from non-fiction espionage and crime thrillers to
politically-motivated intrusions and master tinkerers’ ill-fated
creations. By focusing on the different players involved and their
motivations, I intend not to hype up the scenario, but instead to
accurately describe what we observe daily in the cyber physical threat
intelligence community.</p>
<p>“First Privacy, Now Safety: An Anthology of Tales from the Front
Lines of Cyber Physical Security” will consist of a series of real
stories to illustrate the evolution of cyber physical threats related to
topics that span from non-fiction espionage and crime thrillers to
politically-motivated intrusions and master tinkerers’ ill-fated
creations. The selection of topics results from my personal experience
as a member of the cyber threat intelligence community in Washington,
D.C. with a very pacifist perspective of life. Some example stories
include:</p>
<p>• The Unwilling Pawn – How our infrastructure gets swept up in
geopolitical conflicts • Everybody Be Cool, This is a Robbery! – How
criminals can make more money by getting physical. • What if I Click
Here? – Errant tales from hackers learning about cyber physical systems.
(And sometimes erring in the process).</p>
<p>All of the stories I will talk about can be verified by the audience
in open sources and specialized publications, although they may not
appear in any popular books or videos until a couple years from now.</p>

<p>Pentesting can provide vital information to organisations about their
security. However, many reports end up never being used or not being
used to their full potential. That is partly due to the pentesters and
their writing skills. But in large part is also to be attributed to
CISO's lack of guidance and involvement.</p>
<p>I am not a spokesperson for all CISOs, but I do have quite a bit of
experience in the pentesting field as a CISO. As such; I would like to
share my thoughts about how a CISO can lead the pentesting process as
effectively as possible, as well as what I as a CISO like to see in my
pentesting reports.</p>
<p>I will also highlight why some reports don't get used and why I think
we struggle with this as much as we sometimes do.</p>
<p>I think this information is usefull for pentesters and CISO's alike,
because it shows both sides how the other one works and thinks.</p>
<p>Many pentesting reports are never followed up on, which is a shame,
because a lot of hard work goes into them a lot of the time.</p>
<p>In this talk I will try to explain why this happens and will try to
clarify how we can make some changes to the practice, reporting and
follow up to make pentests more effective.</p>

<p>The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure scans the internet
from our own AS (50.559) for vulnerabilities and reports these to the
people who can fix them. In this session our board members will describe
how we professionalise vulnerability disclosure with an independent
foundation, a Code of Conduct, a common identity, a collaboration
platform for independent researchers and a CSIRT to report
vulnerabilities to owners of vulnerable systems. Our researchers will go
into some of our more known cases, ranging from Citrix 2020, to
KaseyaVSA and Log4j in 2021 and others which commenced between filing
this proposal and the conference. They will demonstrate how to scan,
validate data, report to users and how they responded. By doing this, we
kind of break several laws on computer crime and privacy protection.
Still, we are allowed to as we serve to make the internet more secure.
Moreover, we also guide young security researchers to the responsible
path of vulnerability disclosure. And we do it Dutch style: open, direct
and for free. Chris and Astrid will go into the way we work, Frank and
Lennaert will do the cases.</p>

<p>This talk gives an introduction in how single sign-on protocols (such
as SAML, OAuth 2, and Open ID Connect) work. Subsequently, I will talk
about the most commonly found vulnerabilities in these protocols.
Finally, I will show various ways to resolve these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Single sign-on remains a hot topic in 2022. Many organisations are in
the process of moving identity management and authentication out of of
their application, and offload it to an identity provider. By doing so,
application owners hope to avoid the challenges that come with identity
management. However, the application will still needs to obtain the
user’s identity from the identity provider, which is done using a single
sign-on protocol.</p>
<p>Unfortunately (or fortunately?), single sign-on protocols are
difficult to get right. Flaws in the implementation of single sign-on
protocols can have serious consequences. In the worst case, such flaws
allow hackers to log into the application as an arbitrary user. And this
is not just a theoretical risk, but something I encounter in my work as
ethical hacker on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I will start this talk by giving an introduction to some of the
protocols that are commonly used to achieve single-sign on. Such
protocols include SAML, OAuth 2, and Open ID Connect. Subsequently, I
will talk about the state of single-sign on applications as I encounter
them as an ethical hacker. I will demonstrate which vulnerabilities I
encounter in the real world, and what the consequences of such
vulnerabilities could be.</p>
<p>At the end of this talk, you should have a good overview of how
single sign-on protocols work, what types of vulnerabilities typically
occur in them, and how to protect against such vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>What is inside a Verifone VX820 payment terminal and how can we run
our own code (i.e. Doom) on it?</p>
<p>This is a story of a software guy messing around with an interesting
embedded device. It includes some reverse engineering,
<em>interesting</em> security practices, proprietary executable formats,
and a game of bootloader hopscotch.</p>
<p>Starting with an overview of the Verifone VX820 payment terminal's
hardware and software, we will follow my curious exploration with the
final goal of arbitrary code execution. We will see how such seemingly
single-purpose devices actually allow for general purpose computing
under the hood, and even contain all the peripherals needed for a fun
(retro-)gaming experience.</p>
<p>I will show the struggles and practicalities of turning a (previously
found and published) bootloader vulnerability into a practical exploit.
This includes some reverse-engineering of bootloaders, kernel code,
communication protocols and file headers.</p>
<p>Following this I will cover the "engineering" part: how to construct
a minimum viable "toolchain" to be able to port a codebase like
Doom.</p>
<p>There will be demos of the exploit and some programs that have been
ported :)</p>

<p>If the perfect Blue Team exists, does that mean the Red Team doesn’t
stand a chance against it or is there still a way to sneak their phish
in the mailbox of their target? Well in this talk we investigate how a
Red Team could sneak past even the best Blue Team imaginable. We analyse
how a perfect Blue Team would detect malicious domains targeting their
organization, how they would correlate these to other threat
infrastructure to burn the whole campaign and how they would block a
successful initial foothold in case they did not detect the phish
campaign before its launch. By assuming the perfect adversary, we
discuss techniques and important OPSEC measures Red Teams need to use to
get a successful and undetected initial foothold in their targeted
organization. Through practical demos and real-life examples, attendees
will learn invaluable techniques and OPSEC measures to improve their
Blue or Red Team tradecraft.</p>

in the mailbox of their target? Well in this talk we will investigate
how a Red Team could sneak past the best Blue Team imaginable. By
analyzing techniques the perfect Blue Team would use, we define OPSEC
measures and techniques to remain undetected and accomplish a successful
initial foothold.</p>
<p>How would a perfect Blue Team detect malicious domains targeting
their organization? o BLUE: By dissecting patterns of adversaries and
resulting OPSEC mistakes, we specify how domain and Certificate
Transparency Log monitoring can unveil domains impersonating your
organization. o RED: We explain measures the Red Team can take to avoid
being caught through domain and CTL monitoring by using wildcard SSL
certificates and avoiding typosquatting.</p>
<p>How would a perfect Blue Team correlate detected malicious domains to
related threat infrastructure? o BLUE: Once a suspicious domain is
identified, we can correlate this to other threat infrastructure using
NetLoc intelligence techniques. Through correlation, Blue Teams can
leverage OPSEC mistakes to uncover and potentially burn the whole
campaign. o RED: We explain measures the Red Team can take to avoid the
correlation between their threat infrastructure and avoid the detection
of one domain leading to the whole threat infra being burned.</p>
<p>How would the perfect Blue Team attempt to block undetected phishing
campaigns during their launch. o BLUE: We analyze how the use of
reputational scoring based on IP, Domain and Mail server, can block many
phishing campaigns during the launch itself. o RED: We explain how Red
Teams can age and categorize their domains to pass IP/Domain/Mail based
reputation detections.</p>
<p>What if a phishing mail sneaks by the Blue Team and lands in the
inbox of one of their employees, has Red Team won? Not yet: o BLUE: The
perfect Blue Team has hardened employee endpoints to make a successful
exploitation after a click almost impossible. We discuss several
defensive techniques on how to block successful initial foothold through
Macro execution hardening, Applocker, Exploit Guard and endpoint
security solutions. o RED: Assuming a fully hardened system, we discuss
strategies that could bypass all off these hardening measures and have
been proven to be successful in past engagements</p>
<p>We conclude with a summary of techniques both Blue and Red Teamers
can use to perfect their tradecraft.</p>

<p>There’s no quick fix for the misinformation, disinformation, and lies
were seeing in the world these days, and its natural for hackers want to
work on the problems with the skills at hand. I’m going to talk about
why, for hackers, that’s not necessarily a good move to do solo. I’ll go
over mistakes I’ve seen way too many technologists and academics make
when approaching the subject, where misinformation <em>really</em> comes
from, and where the audience can harness what they’re good at.</p>
<p>It is deceptively easy to see misinformation as a data problem, as a
societal issue of algorithms run amok on soulless social media
platforms. However, just because the delivery of misinformation is
purely technical, it doesn’t mean that the cause, or solution, is also
technical. In the more than half a decade I have been working on
factchecking misinformation and disinformation I have see this point
lost over and over to technologist, hackers, hobbyists and
academics.</p>
<p>This is a huge waste of talented resources, and in this talk I will
go over why this is the case and explain the most serious problems that
journalists, fact-checkers and politicians are facing. Hackers have been
addressing large-scale issues for decades, and my talk will lay a
framework down for how the MCH community and beyond can work on the lies
that are propagated across the internet and the world.</p>
<p>There’s never been more of a need for help, and I will explain how to

improved, and plans for future versions.</p>
<p>PolyCoin - is a game being deployed at MCH 2022, you'll see the
PolyCoin crypto miner units installed throughout the site. This game
involves "capturing" the crypto miners using an RFID card to collect the
fictional crypto currency PolyCoin. Each player selects one of four
fictional global corporations to support, and captures the crypto miners
for their chosen company producing PolyCoins for them. The company with
the most PolyCoins wins!</p>
<p>Delving in to the brief history of the game at EMF Camp 2018 and
2022, and then explaining how it works and the various bits hang
together to create the overall game. Covering PICmicro, ESP8285
(micropython), DFR0299, RC522 RFID, MQTT, Python on Raspberry Pi, and
the hidden features of the game waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>I'll cover the problems with the original game deployed in EMF 2018
and how they were addressed with the PolyCoin game in 2022. Then the
problems encountered in 2022 at EMF camp (far less issues!).</p>
<p>This would ideally be suited to having this presentation followed by
a hands-on session to see the parts that make the game. I should have
enough bits to run a workshop as well to build a PolyCoin crypto miner
unit, including surface mount and hand soldering all the parts and

<p>Tesla is a company that has been innovating in the automobile
industry for many years. They have been designing and manufacturing
electric vehicles which are environmentally friendly and sustainable.
Tesla has also been pioneering and implementing new technologies in the
automotive industry. One of these innovations is their Bluetooth
interface which is used for locking and unlocking vehicles and can be
used to uniquely identify cars, as well as to track them in real-time
with apps like "Tesla Radar".</p>
<p>The introduction of Tesla's Bluetooth passive entry system,
previously only used by model 3 and model y, into new product lines like
the Tesla 2021 Model S/X facelift variant, shows the strategic
importance of this technology for Tesla in the years to come.</p>

<p>In his 1948 <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication">scientific
article</a> entitled <a
href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf">"A
mathematical theory of communication"</a>, Claude E. Shannon introduced
the word “bit”. The article laid down the foundations for the field of
information theory which in turn opened up the way to digital
information processing.</p>
<p>In this overview talk, I will present in an accessible way three
nuggets from Shannon information theory: 1. Shannon entropy, a
mathematical quantification of uncertainty of a probability
distribution. 2. Information Compression: Shannon entropy provides a
fundamental lower bound on how much information from a source can be
compressed so that it can later be recovered. 3. Error correction: when
digital information is transmitted over a noisy channel, the methods of
error-correction provide ways to protect this information from noise.
Yet again, Shannon entropy provides the fundamental quantity of how much
information can be transmitted over a noisy channel.</p>
<p>While the content of this talk is of mathematical nature, I will try
my best to make it accessible to anybody with (very) basic knowledge of
probabilities and programming.</p>
<p>Since 2014, I have been teaching a yearly master course about
information theory at the University of Amsterdam. Together with my PhD
student Yfke Dulek, we have written <a
href="https://github.com/cschaffner/InformationTheory/blob/master/Script/InfTheory3.pdf">lecture
notes</a> on the topic and developed some additional learning tools
based on these notes.</p>
<p>I love the mathematical beauty of Shannon’s information theory, and I
believe that the three concepts above can be appreciated by a much wider
audience that does not regularly read scientific papers of the
mathematical kind. While I will focus on making the fundamental
theoretical aspects accessible to the audience, all of these concepts
also have some interesting (and challenging) programming aspects to them
that can be explored further after my talk.</p>

<p>"SomeApp would like to access files in your Documents folder." Anyone
who has used macOS recently will be familiar with these prompts. But how
do they work? What happens if you deny the access? Are they an effective
defense against malware?</p>
<p>This talk will give an up to date overview of the local security
measures of macOS and describe some ways they can be defeated in
practice.</p>
<p>Sandboxing on macOS was introduced 13 years ago, but Apple didn't
leave it at that. Starting with the release of macOS Catalina in 2019,
even non-sandboxed apps need to deal with sandbox-like restrictions for
files: all apps now need to ask permission to access sensitive files,
like those in the user's documents or desktop folder. Features such as
the camera and geolocation already needed user approval from a
permission prompt. This system of user controlled permissions is known
as Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC).</p>
<p>Any new security measure like this will also mean the introduction of
new security boundaries, with new classes of vulnerabilities. Many parts
of the system have to be re-examined to check for these vulnerabilities.
For example, apps can now try to attack other apps in order to "steal"
the permissions granted by the user to those apps. Apple has taken steps
to allow apps to defend themselves against this, such as the hardened
runtime. Ultimately, however, it is up to the developer of an app to
safeguard its permissions. Many developers are not aware of this new
responsibility or do not take it seriously. Developers who are used to
the security model of Windows or Linux often do not know that these
boundaries even exist. To make matters worse, Apple's documentation and
APIs for these features are not as clear and easy to use as they should
be.</p>
<p>This talk will start with an overview of local security restrictions
on the latest version of macOS, Mojave. Then, it will cover some ways
these protections might be bypassed in third-party applications.
Finally, we will show some vulnerabilities we found in software that
allowed escaping the macOS sandbox, stealing TCC permissions and
privilege escalation, such as CVE-2021-30688, CVE-2020-10009 and
CVE-2020-24428.</p>

<p>In recent times, internet censorship has increased throughout the
world. With governments realising the potential of the internet in
spreading information as well as misinformation. To curb or rather
control this, governments around the globe have taken to censoring parts
of the internet by directing major ISPs to block access to those
websites. The ISPs around the globe have used different methods to block
the access. Some resulting in DNS filtering to others doing SNI ( Server
Name Information ) inspection. There have been ways to bypass these
restrictions, like DoH ( DNS over HTTPS ) and eSNI ( encrypted SNI ),
now ECH ( Encrypted Client Hello ), supported by TLS 1.3. To counter
these, some authoritarian regimes ( like China ) have blocked eSNI
traffic altogether, to be able to sniff the traffic and block the
websites accordingly on their ‘Great Firewall’. I will be talking about
how these different mechanisms of blocking user traffic works, by doing
a live demo of packet analysis using wireshark. Later on in the talk, I
will show a comparative study of the different ISPs around the globe and
what their approaches are at blocking the internet ( if any ). After
understanding how the technologies work, I will show ways to bypass the
censorship by some open source tools, DIY solutions and finally some
paid/managed alternatives. What are the things that one should look for
when choosing one such paid solution. Towards the end, I will announce
the open source repo for the tool used to conduct this project, where
people can contribute and use it for their own research purposes.</p>
<p>I am analysing some of the major ISPs 'around the globe' and how
they’re blocking websites and easy + cost-effective ways to bypass them.
There has been some previous research into this, but that has included
some limited dataset, back in 2020. From then to now a few things have
changed including the way ISPs are blocking websites. With this project,
I am trying to :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Analyse the global censorship of internet
<ol type="1">
<li>Globally, how different ISPs block the network traffic</li>
<li>Distribute the client globally and ask volunteers to run this at
least once</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Release the client and server code as open source</li>
<li>Publish all the data, country wise on a github repo for everyone to
consume</li>
</ol>
<p>The talk would be in two parts : - First : Where I talk about the
technical nitty-gritties as to how censoring in modern times work. -
Second : After understanding how the technologies work, we will try to
bypass those by some open source tools, some DIY solutions and finally
some paid/managed alternatives, what are the things to look for when
choosing one such provider.</p>
<p>Hence, even for folks who aren't much into the technical details of
censorship, would have some arsenal of tools to bypass it, by the end of
the talk. Starting with the famous question : “What happens when you
type a (https) URL in your browser and press enter ?” I will cover all
the aspects, starting with 1. DNS lookup 2. TLS Handshake -
ClientHello,TLS negotiation, ServerHello etc 3. Encrypted Data
Transfer</p>
<p>All of these would be shown a live demo of in wireshark, alongwith
decrypting the traffic using certificates.</p>
<p>Explaining these stages are important because each of these involve
ISPs tampering with to censor the internet. Once we know how it’s done,
we will figure out how to resolve this privacy issue. Like : Stage How
ISPs censorConfirmation TestBypass DNS Lookup Their own DNS as default
DNS filtering Check on dnsleaktest.com Use DoH ( DNS over HTTPS )
dnscrypt</p>
<p>TLS Handshake SNI Inspection Use the tool Check on wireshark Use VPN
eCH</p>
<p>Further move on to ECH ( Encrypted Client Hello ) and why China hates
it . Show a comparative analysis of the different ISPs I’ve tested using
the tool.</p>
<p>Towards the end talk about the open source tool, the client and
server code themselves. The tool, client app : 1. Sends request to alexa
top 1M domains 2. Records packet response and to find what kind of
filtering is in place ( if any ) 3. Sends data to central dashboard
server for generating heatmaps and graphs The tool, server app :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Will consume all the JSON data and validate its findings.</li>
<li>Generate heat maps for all the ISPs and different websites that are
blocked.</li>
</ol>
<p>Talk about solutions to bypassing the censorship : 1. Open source
tools &amp; solutions - DoH, changing default DNS etc 2. DIY things -
self hosted 1-click VPN, ephemeral on-demand sshtunnel etc 3. Paid
solutions - Things to look for when choosing one such paid solution</p>

<p>We will take a cursory look at the protocols that underpin audio over
IP from studios to stages and on to broadcast. Focusing on AES67 the you
will gain a basic understanding of what it is, how it works and how it
is inherently vulnerable to attack. At a high level this talk should be
accessible and entertaining to all, although to grasp the more nuanced
details a rudimentary knowledge of IP networking and audio digitisation
will be helpful.</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>In the professional audio space the heavy and expensive XLR snakes of
old have largely been replaced with audio over IP. Operationally this
move to audio over IP has provided many benefits, such as being able to
use the same equipment for audio as they use for video and lighting
rather than special sets of gear for each aspect of a production.
However with the increased use of commodity IT hardware in this
operational technology (OT) environment comes an increase in attack
surface from more software, easier access and less segmentation. As with
many places where IT components get re-purposed for OT the
administration practices and development practices of the vendors
haven’t necessarily caught up with the with the best practices of there
IT counterparts. There are some hard problems to solve for audio over IP
such as multicast encryption and authentication but also much simpler
but more cultural things like updating a working system.</p>
<p>It is hoped that by presenting this topic to the broader community of
hackers that more talented people get interested in the hard bits, and
perhaps we can even reach the folks on the operational technology side
to see what measures can be taken to improve the security of existing
systems.</p>

<p>drand is an opensource project allowing anybody to run a “randomness
beacon”. Its goal? Providing a trustable, verifiable source of public
randomness that would enable full transparency in online lotteries,
leader election or blockchain smart contracts. This talk is about what
distributed randomness is, what it means for developers, and users, and
why you’d want to use it. I will also present to you the current
ecosystem around drand, and what it enables you to do differently and
why it is desirable in a distributed, decentralized web to have public,
verifiable randomness.</p>
<p>Don’t worry though: we will first go through an easy overview of how
it works without diving too much into the gory cryptographic details. In
addition, I’ll demo how drand works in practice, and explain you how you
can easily use it in your applications since drand nodes can be queried
by anybody.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: this is NOT a blockchain talk, but rather a distributed
system one.</p>
<p><a href="https://drand.love/">drand</a> (pronounced "dee-rand") is a
distributed randomness beacon daemon written in Golang. It has been used
by Cloudflare, EPFL, Kudelski Security, UCL and other partners to setup
a distributed randomness project that was unveiled in June 2019: the <a
href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/league-of-entropy">"League of
Entropy"</a>. Since then even more members have joined the league.</p>
<p>Servers running drand can be linked with each other to produce
collective, publicly verifiable, unbiasable, unpredictable random values
at fixed intervals using bilinear pairings and threshold cryptography.
Drand nodes can also serve locally-generated private randomness to
clients.</p>
<p>Generating public randomness is the primary functionality of drand.
Public randomness is generated collectively by drand nodes and publicly
available. The main challenge in generating good randomness is that no
party involved in the randomness generation process should be able to
predict or bias the final output. Additionally, the final result has to
be third-party verifiable to make it actually useful for applications
like lotteries, sharding, or even "nothing up my sleeves" parameter
generation for security protocols.</p>
<p>drand relies on the following cryptographic constructions: -
Pairing-based cryptography and Barreto-Naehrig curves. - Pedersen's
distributed key generation protocol for the setup. - Threshold BLS
signatures for the generation of public randomness. - ECIES for the
encryption of private randomness.</p>
<p>These are well known, while still relatively cutting edge
cryptographic schemes.</p>
<p>Why do we need such randomness? A lot of reasons actually: -
Lotteries, jury selection, election event, random sampling for audits, …
- Protocols &amp; cryptography: - Verifiable gossip: randomly choosing
peers in a verifiable way in a network to disseminate information -
Parameters: Nonces &amp; IV for symmetric encryptions, composite or
prime numbers for selecting a field for RSA, or even ECC - Schemes:
Diffie Hellman exchange, Schnorr signatures, more generally for zero
knowledge proofs, - Protocols: Tor (e.g. path selection), sharding
(Omniledger), leader election for consensus - Statistics: verifiable
random sampling, reducing bias e.g. in controlled trials in medicine,
etc.</p>
<p>Now, drand is a software ran by a set of independent nodes that
collectively produce randomness and whose long term goal is to implement
Randomness-as-a-Service: - Fetching randomness should be as simple as
fetching time from NTP servers. - Nodes can serve both private
randomness and public randomness: - Unpredictable and bias-resistant -
Publicly Verifiable - Decentralized service using threshold
cryptography, with high availablity, reliability and trust.</p>
<p>This talk will NOT be about just the cryptography behind drand, but I
will cover some of the basics in a simple way in order to tease the
people that could be interested, while introducing cool cryptographic
constructions to the rest. It will NOT be about how drand is built, but
it will really be about the <strong>practical use-cases for
drand</strong>, how to use it, its kind of randomness, what it means and
why you might want to use it.</p>

<p>Mechanical locks are everywhere and come in all shapes and flavors.
But choosing the right lock can be rather difficult. For example, what
is better? A lock that is hard to pick, or a lock with hard to duplicate
keys. This talk will not give you the answers, but it will help you
understand the trade-offs. Furthermore, we will have fun threat modeling
our locks.</p>
<p>Is lockpicking a threat you should be concerned about, or is the
brick the tool you should care for? Jan-Willem, from The Open
Organization of Lockpickers (Toool), will share his ideas on mechanical
security and threat modeling. We will make it fun and use several case
studies, starting with defining a lock, threat modeling mechanical
puzzles, and use several case studies where the threat was overrated.
Simply put, attacks against locks range from the trivial to mastery.
I'll share multiple failed attempts of attacks that should be trivial,
but were not in practice, and we will analyze them together.</p>

<p>Only three years ago you wouldn't have had a chance to get this
so-called reality past any decent editor. Now, plotting a book or movie
has become increasingly hard and the next years in publishing will be
interesting, since our standards in what is scary or believable or how
dumb can one be to do XY as a book character, to get into whatever
problems, have tremendously changed.</p>
<p>I'm an author, writing crime novels and scifi and during the last
three years, some collegues and I have often said the phrase "if this
was a book, you wouldn't get that past an editor". But it seems, our
standards on what is real, believable or doable have changed somewhat
over the pandemic. This does not only afflict society itself (fake news,
mobs, conspiracy myths etc.), but also (pop) culture and the its
creators like authors of books or movie scripts. I have no forecast, on
where we might end up or if movies and books will return to story worlds
of our old believes, but I can share musings about society, tech and
humanity's deepest desire in stories and authors who have to face a
different kind of basic understanding of the world to start from when
writing stories.</p>

<p>The use of data is accelerating, not only owing to increasing
technical possibilities like AI and earth observation, but also as a
result of crises such as COVID-19 and climate change which accelerate
the deployment of data and technology. This is happening on a small and
local scale, as well as on a large and global one. Precisely because
these data are potentially personal, and its use is becoming
commonplace, it is urgent to internalize shared principles for the
responsible use of data to achieve greater common value, better data and
better products. These are preferably intrinsic principles that
guarantee the safety and privacy of people, our social values and human
dignity. In this talk we discuss an ethical framework for the use of
location data. Together with the crowd we will investigate several
dilemma's in which location data play an important role. How far can you
go? Which values are more important? These are the kind of questions we
will present and discuss.</p>
<p>The ethical framework is designed for the use of (personal) location
data.</p>
<p>How do we ensure that the technology we develop is at the service of
society? How do we respect shared public values and the individual
rights when developing applications made possible by location data? With
the discussions that have erupted around apps for monitoring the
COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that the answers to these questions are
not crystal clear.</p>
<p>The purpose of the ethical reference is to inspire data users, but
also policy makers and decision makers to help them collect, use and
apply personal location data responsibly. Location data are all data
that show where people are located and how they move, whether or not
they can be traced. This data can, for example, be collected via mobile
apps.</p>
<p>In this talk we discuss the different values that are conflicting in
the use of location data. We present several dilemma's and cases and
will involve the public actively in discussing these dilemma's.</p>

<p>The web is a mess, bloated with data-gathering trackers, predatory
UX, massive resource loads, and it is absorbing everything it touches.
The Small Internet is a counter-cultural movement to wrangle things back
under control via minimalism, hands-on participation, and good old
fashioned conversation. At its heart are technologies like the venerable
Gopher protocol or the new Gemini protocol offering a refuge and a place
to dream of a better future.</p>
<p>Join me and be reintroduced to Gopher in 2021 and learn what this old
friend has to offer us in a world full of web services and advertising
bombardment. We will also explore the new Gemini protocol and how it
differs from Gopher and HTTP.</p>
<p>We will explore the protocols themselves, their history, and what the
modern ecosystems are like. I will briefly review the technical details
of implementing servers or clients of your own, and how to author
content as a user. Discussion will cover limitations, grey-areas, and
trade-offs in exchange for speed and simplicity.</p>
<p>Through these alternative protocols we'll see the small internet in
action.</p>

<p>One of the most used video entry systems is analysed for this talk.
Severe security implications that range from passive, information
gathering, attacks to active attacks where unauthorised access to
buildings can be gained. During the talk the technical details of the
bus system will be discussed and multiple attackvectors will be
demonstrated. At the end of the talk the disclosure procedure to high
value targets and the manufacturer are also discussed.</p>
<p>Feeling safe at home and at work is one of the most basic
requirements for living. Part of being, and feeling, safe is the
physical access system of the building. For this talk the video intercom
system designed and manufactured by one of the most used brands in
building access control and video entry technology is… evaluated. In
order to paint a picture of the magnitude of the security implications
it is good to mention that this system is not just used in apartment
buildings but also in government offices such as the probation office in
The Netherlands.</p>
<p>The talk will discuss the technical aspects of the bus system and how
and why this has major security implications. Not only passive attacks
will be shown but also more active attacks that can compromise physical
security in the buildings where the system is used.</p>
<p>The talk will also include how disclosure to some potential targets
was done. The reaction from the manufacturer will also be discussed in
the talk.</p>

<p>The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability disclosure goes international.
We’re building a community of enthusiasts to help stop the downward
spiral of the internet, we’re calling it CSIRT.global. It’s aimed at
international collaboration. Trust and communication, balanced with a
sense of reality about the sensitive information we deal with, are key.
Here’s how you can help, one vulnerability at a time.</p>
<p>The internet is wonderful. It is also broken and spiralling downward.
Governments and big tech often don’t serve the interests of internet
enthusiasts. Some people decided to “be the change”. In 2019, The Dutch
Institute for Vulnerability was founded, and now it has over 70
volunteers. You have likely heard of our work, like Citrix and Kaseya.
Communication is key in disclosing and informing organizations.
Internationally, this can pose a real challenge. Therefore, we are
building an international community, and we’re calling it CSIRT.global.
Trust and communication are key. In this talk, you will learn why we’re
expanding, what our challenges are, how we deal with sensitive
information, and why it’s logical a volunteer organisation takes the
lead. Finally, you’ll learn how you can help.</p>

<p>Reproducible Builds is a technique that can be used to secure the
software delivery pipeline.</p>
<p>For open source software, they even allow independently auditing
published binaries, removing a single point of trust from the
distribution process. This can be used by individual projects or even
complete Linux distributions.</p>
<p>The software delivery pipeline is an increasingly popular attack
vector: even when your project source code is known-good (audited), an
attacker can inject malware by gaining access to the machine used to
build (and sign) the binaries.</p>
<p>Reproducible Builds provides a mechanism to counter such attacks: by
building the same source code on independently-administered machines and
comparing their outcome.</p>
<p>Several Linux distributions (Debian, Arch, openSUSE, NixOS, OpenWrt,
…) are working towards using Reproducible Builds to make their binary
packages independently verifiable, but also individual projects use it
to verify their deliverables. This talk will give an overview of
progress, results and next steps.</p>

<p>This workshop is the hands-on version of the talk we will give on
Saturday. We will shorty look at the research we are doing at Greenpeace
on digital disobedience actions. Also we will introduce the 4 different
action tactics we work with at Greenpeace, Direct Action, Mass Protest,
Direct Communication and Photo Opportunity and use these as a basis to
come up with digital actions.</p>
<p>The workshop and working in your group consists of two parts: Part1:
Brainstorm. Try to translate your action tactic to the digital domain.
Part2: pick the best action you designed and check if it is actually
doable/feasible. Final: present it to the whole group</p>
<p>We have identified two potential targets that Greenpeace is working
on…. Who will that be? ;)</p>
<p>Greenpeace is a direct action organization. We have been doing direct
civil disobedient actions for 50 years now. At Greenpeace we know our
strength and our weaknesses when doing actions in physical spaces. We
scale buildings and hang banners, we have blocked the petrol harbour in
Rotterdam (multiple times) and we stop oil/gas rigs from operating. All
these kinds of actions are part of a struggle for a healthy climate and
safe planet to live on and so ideologically motivated.</p>
<p>The right to protest is a fundamental European right, a right that is
very dear to us and important when chased by the law. At Greenpeace we
always look at new ways to do disobedient actions. This is why we
started a research on how online actions can contribute to campaigns.
The last few months we have been looking into the possibilities of
digital civil disobedience actions. We looked at the risks, the actions
and the possibilities it will bring. One thing we learned is that
everyone we talk to about this topic is super excited.</p>

<p>Transforming the boring parts of web application testing with
automation, scalability and a lot of requests: How to automate flagging
the potentially vulnerable components and web application parts? Making
the tooling work for you and not vice versa? Want to figure out how to
build a simple DAST testing case for your application or interested to
see how to go from few lines of shellscript or Python to a fully fledged
bug bounty hunting automation? Let's make it happen!</p>
<p>In this workshop the participants will discover new tools and learn
new techniques for building automation tasks to find web application
vulnerabilities. The workshop revolves around typical vulnerability
classes, and explores the requirements to find and validate
vulnerabilities using automation.</p>
<p>Participants are provided with a virtual test environment with
existing vulnerabilities to fine tune their workflows and to discover
more efficient ways to find their way around the web application
jungle.</p>
<p>This event is suitable for beginners as well as more advanced web
application hackers, system administrators and developers alike.</p>
<p>Minimum requirements to get the best out of this workshop: - Laptop
with Linux based operating system or a Linux VM - Basic knowledge of
*NIX command line</p>

<p>At its core, systemd is a "system and service manager - an init
system used to bootstrap user space and manage user processes. It also
provides replacements for various daemons and utilities, including
device management, login management, network connection management, and
event logging" for Linux operating systems. (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>Or, to take it more wildly: "systemd takes all the init features
formerly implemented with sticky tape, shell script hacks, and the sweat
of administrators and formalizes them in a unified field theory of how
services should be configured, accessed, and managed."</p>

<p>At its core, systemd is a "system and service manager - an init
system used to bootstrap user space and manage user processes. It also
provides replacements for various daemons and utilities, including
device management, login management, network connection management, and
event logging" for Linux operating systems. (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>Systemd is in use in most distributions, so, when using Linux, you
presumably do not have a choice like 'take it or leave it'. You can't
avoid it. You just have to bite the bullet.</p>
<p>This talk is also aimed at diehards, to whom I say: "Ignore the
controversy for a bit and give systemd a chance to win your love"</p>
<p>Let me assist you.</p>
<p>I was asked to make this presentation in 2020 because … no such thing
was available. When looking at the courses conducted by a Dutch
UNIX/Linux training company, I must say: they tell you about systemd,
but the details are somewhat scattered among their sysadmin training
courses. Nowadays YMMV.</p>
<p>So I happily started making the presentation and used this for the
introduction: "systemd takes all the init features formerly implemented
with sticky tape, shell script hacks, and the sweat of administrators
and formalizes them in a unified field theory of how services should be
configured, accessed, and managed."</p>
<p>The presentation is interspersed with hands on parts, in which I use
many examples to give you an idea of how to use those hundreds of
commands and thousands of options. I also found a way to circumvent
typing errors.</p>

<p>Are you interested in maps? Are you searching for a FLOSS mapping
navigation? Do you need geodata? Do you need a map on your site? Do you
want to help creating maps from your local environment or from
vulnerable places? Then, you have come to the right talk! This talks
gives a broad overview of OpenStreetMap, the community and how to get
started with it.</p>
<p>Note: 1st session is in Dutch, the 2nd session is in English</p>
<p>OpenStreetMap is an open database of geodata and has become the
biggest geodataset of the world. It is often called 'the wikipedia of
maps' and is getting used in more and more applications - from grassroot
movements to big corporations. But it can be confusing to dive into the
ecosystem.</p>
<p>In this talk, I'll give a high-level overview of OpenStreetMap and
answer the most important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is OpenStreetMap (and what is it not?)</li>
<li>What applications exist?</li>
<li>What tools exist?</li>
<li>How can one contriute?</li>
<li>How can one export data?</li>
<li>How can one get in touch with the local mapping community?</li>
</ul>
<p>No previous experience with mapping or GIS needed! This is a talk, so
you don't have to bring anything. However, if you need some help with
your first OSM-edits, I'll stick around after the talk to get you
started. In that case, it might be useful to bring your laptop (or
smartphone)</p>

<p>Observing and measuring Internet traffic can tell us a lot about the
health and resiliency of Internet locally, regionally and globally.
There is a constant increase in global political and social instability
which often leads to Internet shutdowns or disruptions. We at the NCC
are looking into improving our internet measurement tools so that they
can be used to detect, analyze and document these events.</p>
<p>RIPE Atlas is a network of 11000+ globally distributed probes that
perform active internet measurements 24/7. It is a community project,
data gathered by built-in measurements is open to everyone. Customized
measurements could be public or private, as per decision of measurement
owner.</p>
<p>If there is a suspected internet shutdown, we might get an insight
into what kind of shutdown we're seeing, how the traffic is flowing in
and out of the country/region thanks to a high number of vantage points
and ability to run custom measurements towards key elements of internet
infrastructure (like root DNS servers). We built various tools on top of
Atlas, for example IPmap which might also be helpful to visualize
traffic flows. Routing Information Service (RIS) - platform for
collecting and storing Internet routing data - is another useful NCC
tool.</p>
<p>We used Atlas and RIS data to look into resiliency of Ukrainian
Internet
(https://labs.ripe.net/author/emileaben/the-resilience-of-the-internet-in-ukraine)
and how conflict/sanctions affected Russian networks
(https://labs.ripe.net/author/emileaben/how-is-russia-connected-to-the-wider-internet).</p>
<p>We are choosing a workshop format because we want to collect feedback
from both technical and not-strictly technical people on how to improve
our platform and to learn which features might be missing.</p>

<p>Let us have a discussion about what bad communication is and how to
avoid it in the future - especially when you interact with others. There
are five common patterns we fall into, when we are communicating badly.
This workshop will give you the tools to recognise these anti-patterns
in yourself and others and furthermore the knowledge on how to change
your communication for the better in the future. This will support you
in getting your message understood.</p>
<p>Have you ever been in a situation where your communication went all
wrong? When an open conversation turned into an argument that left you
wondering "Why did this happen?"</p>
<p>This happens to all of us. Having an understanding about the five
most common roles and anti-patterns of bad communication, can help
prevent them from happening. Or help you to get out of them.</p>
<p>Understanding of these roles also helps you to create space for good
communication – I.e., what to do and say, when you discover that your
conversation partner acts accordingly to one of the anti-patterns.</p>
<p>This workshop will explain these roles and anti-patterns, discovering
the signs, the reasons behind them, and what to focus on in order to
avoid them. It will focus on spoken communication, not on other aspects
like body language, facial expression or context and setting.</p>
<p>The workshop is a mixture presentation, group chat and
self-reflection.</p>
<p>About me</p>
<p>I am is intrigued by words and passionate about communication, the
way we relate with each other and the connections and cultures we
create.</p>
<p>I work as a transformative coach for individuals and organisations
and communication is at the core of every interaction in my life - "You
can not not communicate".</p>

<p>This <strong>workshop</strong> is for <strong>girls and boys</strong>
age 7-18.<br />
Programming is not difficult! Here we learn from each other and the
coaches how to program by doing it ourselves.<br />
We bring a range of robotics: Makeblock Mbot, Mbot2, Ultimate, Grove,
Ozobot, Makey Makey, Microbit with Maqueen.<br />
There is only one rule: <strong>Above all: be cool!</strong></p>
<h3 id="about-coderdojo">About Coderdojo:</h3>
<p>Coderdojo organises free programming clubs, called "<em>Dojos</em>".
At these Dojos girls and boys, the <em>Ninjas</em>, learn to program,
make websites, apps and develop games.<br />
The dojos are run by volunteers: <em>Coaches</em> to trigger the spark
in the Ninjas and <em>Cooks</em> to handle practical stuff like
registration, snacks, drinks.<br />
The stars of the show are the Ninjas who meet equal minded participants
to collaborate and to show each other what they are working on.<br />
Coderdojo shows that programming is not only for nerds. Our coders build
super nice projects and are the ultimate example that technology can be
fun.<br />
We have one rule: <strong>"Above all: be cool!"</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="practical-information-2">Practical Information:</h3>
<p>This workshop is for girls and boys age 7-18 (experience with Scratch
will give you a headstart, others will get a quick Scratch Intro).<br />
If you are younger than 12, you are best accompanied by a parent.<br />

<p>If you drop by with a Laptop running "Kali Linux" either from
USB-Stick or from within a virtual machine, I will walk you through the
necessary steps. From analysing the target system, finding exploits, on
to successfully hacking the "victim" using metasploit. And if you are
quick enough and behave, we might even get so far as to remotely
crashing the system.</p>
<p>This is an introductory level workshop targeted at a novice/beginner
level audience that wants to learn how "hacking" actually works. InfoSec
personnel and other "professionals" attending this session will get
shanghaied into supporting the other attendees.</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Bring your own/a Laptop running a recent version of
Kali-Linux inside a virtual machine or from a USB stick.</p>

<p>Participants will learn the complete workflow of creating a circuit
board with KiCad. At the end of the workshop, you will have a designed
PCB that blinks some LEDs and is ready for manufacturing. No prior
experience is required, basic electronics knowledge is useful.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: You need to bring a Notebook with KiCad
6.x including the symbol- and footprint libraries installed. It does not
matter which OS. If possible, bring a mouse with a scroll-wheel.</p>
<p>The workshop will have a 10-15minutes lecture part in the beginning
where the whole process is demonstrated. You won't need to take notes, a
cheat-sheet with the process-steps and the most important shortcuts will
be provided. After the introduction you will draw a simple circuit that
blinks two LEDs. Create the layout for it and export manufacturing data.
Experienced KiCad users will be around the whole time to answer
questions and</p>
<p>People who know KiCad already are welcome as well. For discussion as
well as additional help.</p>
<p>You can get KiCad at https://www.kicad.org/ (<strong>don't'</strong>
use kicad-pcb.org). Most linux distributions will also have a packaged
version, make sure to also install the symbol and footprint
libraries.</p>

<p>In this workshop, we will learn how to assemble tiny parts on circuit
boards by building an electronic touch-activated purring kitten. Anyone
can do it. Yes, even you who never touched anything electronic before.
Takes 120mins, 20€/kit, avoid caffeine immediately before. Max 10
participants per session, sign up on PAPER at the Hardware Hacking
Area.</p>
<p>Takes about two hours. Basic workshop. No prior knowledge needed.
Materials cost 20€ per kit.</p>
<p>We are going to build an electronic kitten using tiny tiny SMD parts.
It will purr when you touch it right and hiss when you touch it wrong.
It's going to work. You will learn how to make your hands not shake at
all ever. You will learn how to activate your builtin precision
positioning superpowers.</p>
<p>For people afraid of surface mount assembly/rework. You know those
tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible
and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you
how!</p>
<p>Think you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s?
Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is
minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to
THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no
longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the
workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The workshop kit costs 20€. Please SIGN UP ON THE PAPER LIST at the
Hardware Hacking Area. PLEASE BE ON TIME!</p>

<p>Is this a workshop or an execuse to play with a very cool lego set?
It's both!</p>
<p>Lego Mindstorms is a hardware and software structure which develops
programmable robots based on Lego building blocks. Each version includes
computer Lego bricks, a set of modular sensors and motors, and Lego
parts from the Technic line to create the mechanical systems. The system
is controlled by the Lego bricks.</p>
<p>While originally conceptualized and launched as a tool for supporting
educational constructivism, Mindstorms has become the first home
robotics kit available to a wide audience. It has developed a community
of adult hobbyists and hackers following the product's launch in
1998</p>
<p>In this workshop under the guidance of the Disturbinator you will
learn how the Mindstorms platform works.</p>
<p>It is a workshop, is it an excuse to play. Is it just fun or is it
serius? You decide.</p>

<p>Smart lights have become pervasive in many homes, but they are often
designed in such a way that makes them completely reliant on the
manufacturer's servers and connectivity to the Internet. However, we
would much rather be fully in control of our own devices.</p>
<p>As a target, we took on the cheap and popular Tuya white-label smart
lights, which can be commonly found under many different brand
names.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll take you on a trip through our 1-year journey of
hacking these devices, including the details of finding and remotely
exploiting a vulnerability in the firmware for devices based on the
custom BK7231 SoC.</p>
<p>Smart lights have become pervasive in many homes, but they are often
designed in such a way that makes them completely reliant on the
manufacturer's servers and connectivity to the Internet. However, for
people who want full control of their own devices, there weren't many
affordable and easily usable options.</p>
<p>One such option became available near the end of 2018 when a
vulnerability was discovered in the firmware of smart devices
manufactured by Tuya Smart. Shortly after the discovery of said
vulnerability, a project by the name of tuya-convert popped up. It
allowed its users to remotely flash Tuya devices with custom firmware by
exploiting the - at the time - new vulnerability.</p>
<p>By 2020, however, tuya-convert stopped working for an increasing
number of new devices. The manufacturer had patched the vulnerability,
and unexploitable devices have begun showing up on the market. That's
when we decided to look for the next vulnerability for Tuya's smart
devices in order to allow remote custom firmware flashing once more.</p>
<p>We spent some time hacking on early devices which were based on the
ESP8266 platform, and a while later switched to the newer devices based
on the custom BK7231 SoC. During the course of our research, we found
issues in firmware on both platforms and rediscovered some helpful
reversing techniques.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll cover our research journey with its ups and downs
on both platforms, as well as the details of a memory corruption
vulnerability which we exploited on the BK7231-based devices.</p>

start building your own projects with these building blocks. MQTT is a
very light message transport mechanism that uses a standard network
connection and a subscribe-publish protocol to get messages from one
device to one or more others in the network in a structured manner.
Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices,
APIs and online services very suited for working with MQTT messages.
Tasmota started as a universal firmware for ESP8266/8285 IoT-devices,
now with added support for the ESP32 and it comes with MQTT-support out
of the box. With these tools, a raspberry pi and a few lines of script,
we can start building home automation or whatever you want.</p>

<p>A high bar set by earlier creations, a pandemic, a postponed event
and chip shortages made for a great challenge and a wild adventure
creating the MCH2022 badge. This talk explains how we pulled off our
most advanced creation yet. We will tell you about the process of
converting a vague idea into a piece of electronics, including the
prototyping process and the difficulties we encountered.</p>
<p>Bodging badges in a time where the pandemic and the chip shortage

<p>The MCH2022 design speaks for itself, but we would still nerd about
it for a while. It is beautiful, colorful, generative, and has some
physics ideas behind it. Some of it is obvious, but if you want to know
all the hidden depths, this is the talk to visit.</p>
<p>The triangulair MCH2022 design is a colourfull generative
kaleidoscope with some hidden depths. In that way it reflects the hacker
community. It is in some ways a spiritual successor to the SHA2017
design, but it has its own look and feel. You can find it all around the
field, on prints and stickers, on the website and on the event
shirts.</p>
<p>Do you want to know the nitty gritty details of the optical physics,
the generative basis and symmetric math ideas behind it? Some of it is
obvious, but we would like to talk about it, and go deeper in on the
concepts.</p>

<p>The traditional talk by most or all operational teams about the
infrastructure built for MCH2022. While the site has some infrastructure
in place, a lot of it has to be built for this event. On the other hand
there's also teams that just make things go away.</p>
<p>MCH2022 can not be organised without a lot of temporary
infrastructure. Join the operational teams and discover the new, the
unexpected or the surprising technologies that were necessary to make
MCH2022 a success. Expect graphs, pictures of bodges, perhaps a few
hacks but definitely a lot of hard work behind the scenes. Think fiber,
LEDs, DatenKlos, trusses, waste bags, Terabytes, angels, vouchers,
simultaneous viewers, amps, volts, golf carts etc. Please smile (or
laugh) at our bad jokes, we're all running on fumes and in desperate
need of a proper sleep.</p>

<p>Open source code makes up 90% of most codebases. How do you know if
you can trust your open source dependencies? Do you know what’s really
going on in your node_modules folder? It is critical to manage your
dependencies effectively to reduce risk but most teams have an ad-hoc
process where any developer can introduce dependencies. Software supply
chain attacks have exploded over the past 12 months and they’re only
accelerating in 2022. We’ll dive into examples of recent supply chain
attacks targeting the JavaScript, Node.js, and npm ecosystems, as well
as concrete steps you can take to protect your apps, projects, and teams
from this emerging threat.</p>

<p>Since early 2021, it has been impossible to buy most integrated
circuits and various other components. I'll explain how and why this
happened, why it's going to keep happening, and where the fragility of
the electronics manufacturing ecosystem comes from.</p>
<p>A terrible miscalculation by one unrelated industry (car
manufacturing) caused the entire electronics market to fall apart in a
spectacular way, meaning that for over a year now it's been impossible
to buy many important electronic components, including most ICs. I'll
talk about how the electronics component ecosystem is structured, why
it's inherently fragile, and how everyone acting in their own best
interest has made the problem worse. I'll also share some stories about
working around supply issues at various companies and projects I've been
involved with during this period.</p>
<p>Come hear a fireside chat about how car companies are trash, how you
can build a world economy on shortsightedness, and how two conference
calls can bring down the entire world's supply of essential parts.</p>

<p>In 2017 (just before SHA2017) the Dutch healthcare sector came
together to create Stichting Z-CERT, the Zorg Computer Emergency
Response Team. A nonprofit to protect and advise the Dutch Healthcare
sector. What started as a small startup has now grown into a scaleup
with the ambitions to match. The COVID-19 pandemic restarted the
discussion about whether or not healthcare is vital infrastructure. With
NIS2 the role and importance of Z-CERT will only grow from here on. This
talk is not to intended to be a corporate “Look how great we are and

<p>The whole world depends on Global Navigation Satellite Systems like
GPS, Galileo, BeiDou and GLONASS. The technology behind these systems is
fascinating and far more interested than generally presented. Although
GNSS is super important, up to recently no good monitoring was publicly
available. The "galmon.eu" project changed this.</p>
<p>In this talk I cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>How your phone really figures out where it is (so it can sell more
expensive ads)
<ul>
<li>How the "satellite ephemeris" is broadcast, what it means</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is really in this 'assisted GPS'?</li>
<li>The extensive ground infrastructure that is active 24/7 to determine
the satellite orbits so GNSS is precise enough to tell which store you
are in, or which side of the road you are driving on</li>
<li>How GNSS are monitored in public by 100 Galmon.eu volunteers,
running open source receivers all over the world
<ul>
<li>And the research we enable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discussion of suitable hardware and GNSS-SDR that allows hackers to
see each and every bit coming from the satellites</li>
<li>A brief part on how GNSS can be spoofed and jammed, and the odd
cryptography used to help detect or prevent this</li>

behind that little circle on your maps app, but also to explain how

data.</p>
<p>We provide the software and assembly guide for the DIY sensor kits
for citizen empowerment.</p>
<p>Mission Statement: Sensor.Community is a contributors driven global
sensor network that creates Open Environmental Data.</p>
<p>Our mission is to inspire and enrich people’s lives by offering a
platform for the collective curiosity in nature that is genuine, joyful
and positive.</p>
<p>Sensor.Community started 2015 in Stuttgart / South Germany as a local
project. The goal then was the deployment of 300 low cost Air-Quality
sensors in Stuttgart. These devices should be easy to build for
everyone. Until now the platform has grown to more than 14.000 sensors
in over 70 countries (January 2022).</p>
<p>These sensors are measuring environmental data as Air-Quality,
temperature, pressure and relative humidity. You can see the live values
on the live map at Maps.Sensor.Community. Everything ever measured is
available as Open Environmental Data. You can download all historical
Open Data.</p>
<p>To participate you can join a local group which you can discover on
the community layer of the map where live values are displayed. -&gt;
https://maps.sensor.community/#2/0.0/0.0</p>
<p>We invite you to become part of the community. Build a sensor,
generate Open Data, share it in a continuous stream with the network and
join forces in local Sensor.Community groups to analyse it. Find
like-minded people which care about the environment and the implications
on our health. Stay informed and exchange with your neighbours.</p>
<p>Once the sensor tube is connected to the network its measured values
are available live on the map at Sensor.Community. These values are
refreshed every 2 ½ minutes and enable all citizens to see how the
situation is around them.</p>
<p>The available historical Open Data of all ever measured values enable
other projects to serve citizens with other specific services and
functionality.</p>
<p>Sensor.Community is here to serve citizens on a global layer with
environmental Open Data. Our focus is to add further sensor methods,
collaborate with institutions as RIVM.nl on data standards and better
integrations in their daily work. One great example here is the
integration of the Open Data from Sensor.Community into the Data-portal
of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the
Netherlands at RIVM.nl</p>

<p>So, you know how to "use" the ssh command line? You enter connection
parameters like username, hostname or private key every time you need to
connect? You manually log into the jump/bastion host when connecting to
your target host? Then come to this session and learn how you can make
your life easier and your work more efficient by using custom config
files and a tiny little bit of preparation.</p>

<p>Are you curious, and looking for a fun project perhaps this workshop
is something for you? The capabilities of both generating and collecting
data have been increasing rapidly in the last several decades. Everybody
needs info / data in life. Some examples: In your job to find new
businesses opportunity’s or just to "spy" on employees or your
competitors? Reverse engineering for a simple replay attack, you might
need to know the frequency, Chip vendor .or layout Finding your long
lost friends, loves-once from long ago. Some time's you know it must be
out there somewhere but you just can't find it. Why can't you find it
and how to improve your search skills on gathering or collecting data.
Step by step I will guide you in the art off “collecting data”. And NO
is not an option is something I hope to gain.</p>
<p>This is NOT an debate about the ethics or politics of online
reconnaissance on personal information gathering.* Further this is not a
guide/training to steal information for criminal purposes.</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The name of collecting data in Military terms is Open-source
intelligence, often referred to as OSINT. This word OSINT can mean many
things to many people.“Officially, it is defined as any data or
Intelligence produced from publicly available information that is
collected, exploited or disseminated in a manner to an audience in a
form of an rapport or spoken word.” The main word for collection data is
OSINT or Open-source intelligence this is just like an treasure chest.
Mostly It includes lots of "possibly sensitive information". Sometimes
it is publicly available on the internet, and the best of all, it’s
“free”. With some simple tooling you can find more than you aspect. No
need for expensive hardware, all you need is an internet browser and a
terminal You could do this from you're phone all you need is an terminal
and an browser.</p>
<p>Some topics: Please keep in mind that tools and tricks get quickly
obsolete.</p>

data analysis (Data mining) Finding a (new) job with the help off open
source data Animal tracking (cows)</p>
<p>Social media content hidden, alias profile’s missing profile data

<p>In this workshop, we will learn how to assemble tiny parts on circuit
boards by building an electronic touch-activated purring kitten. Anyone
can do it. Yes, even you who never touched anything electronic before.
Takes 120mins, 20€/kit, avoid caffeine immediately before. Max 10
participants per session, sign up on PAPER at the Hardware Hacking
Area.</p>
<p>Takes about two hours. Basic workshop. No prior knowledge needed.
Materials cost 20€ per kit.</p>
<p>We are going to build an electronic kitten using tiny tiny SMD parts.
It will purr when you touch it right and hiss when you touch it wrong.
It's going to work. You will learn how to make your hands not shake at
all ever. You will learn how to activate your builtin precision
positioning superpowers.</p>
<p>For people afraid of surface mount assembly/rework. You know those
tiny little components in modern electronic devices? It's both possible
and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you
how!</p>
<p>Think you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s?
Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is
minimal and you probably already have it. We'll learn the answer to
THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no
longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the
workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The workshop kit costs 20€. Please SIGN UP ON THE PAPER LIST at the
Hardware Hacking Area. PLEASE BE ON TIME!</p>
